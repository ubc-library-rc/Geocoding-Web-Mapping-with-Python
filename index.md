# Geocoding and Web Mapping with Python

Workshop created by June Skeeter (They/Them/Theirs) skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca for the UBC Library Search Commons

# Land Acknowledgement
I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.  This data map was pulled from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).  This is by no means a definitive source, but it's a good place to start building an understanding of the Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

# Content Warning

This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.  We are going to use a dataset of police involved deaths in Canada from 2000-2017.  The data was obtained from Pivot Legal Society and initially collected by the CBC.  The intent behind choosing this dataset end goal of this workshop is to show that programming and data analysis can be powerful tools for promoting social and environmental justice issues.  


### Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?

Canadian policing institutions rely on secrecy and the a of statistics to perpetuate the narrative that police violence and systemic racism are "just American issues" and that Canada is "better".  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.  But it is patently untrue, police violence and systemic racism are serious issues in Canadian society and they need to be part of the public discourse in order to dismantle these systems of oppression and hold Canadian institutions accountable.



# Learning Objectives

1) Cursory overview to python
2) Introduction to geocoding with python
3) Creating simple web-maps with python

### The end goal of the workshop is to produce an interactive web-map
