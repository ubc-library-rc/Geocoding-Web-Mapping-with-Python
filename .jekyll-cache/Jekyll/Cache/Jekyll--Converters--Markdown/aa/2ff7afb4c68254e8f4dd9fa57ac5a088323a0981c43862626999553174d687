<h1 id="content-warning">Content Warning</h1>

<p>This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.  We are going to use a dataset of police killings and police involved deaths in Canada.  The intent behind choosing this dataset end goal of this workshop is to show that GIS, programming, data analysis, and data visualization can be powerful tools for promoting social and environmental justice issues.</p>

<h1 id="territorial-acknowledgement">Territorial Acknowledgement</h1>

<p>UBC and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.  Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-a-territorial-acknowledgement">Why Do a Territorial Acknowledgement?</h2>

<p>For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe.  In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada.  There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map.  Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.  A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that.  It isn’t just a formality.  It is a time to reflect and build understanding.  The maps and information presented below are sourced from <a href="https://native-land.ca/">native-land.ca</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>

<p>Why do we say <em>traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Traditional</strong>: recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied.  The <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/">xʷməθkʷəy̓əm</a>, and <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/">əl̓ilwətaɁɬ</a>, <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/">Skwxwú7mesh-ulh</a>Nations have traditionally occupied this area.</p>

<p><strong>Ancestral</strong>: recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.  It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land.  Language has strong connections to ancestry.  The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/">Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓</a> and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/">Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unceded</strong>: refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.  Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty.</p>

<h1 id="why-police-involved-deaths-in-canada">Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?</h1>

<p>Canadian policing institutions rely on secrecy and the a of statistics to perpetuate the narrative that police violence and systemic racism are “just American issues” and that Canada is “better”.  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.  But it is patently untrue, police violence and systemic racism are serious issues in Canadian society and they need to be part of the public discourse in order to dismantle these systems of oppression and hold Canadian institutions accountable.</p>
