<p>Its a great language! But its not the only language. Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi could all be used to explain systemic racism; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to quantify and visualize the scale of the problem.   like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it‚Äôs completely free!</p>

<h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>

<p>Python has a number of built in functionality, but many of the most useful tools and functions come require us to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import">import</a> packages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Packages are pre-written blocks of code, sometimes referred to as libraries.</li>
  <li>They are built for addressing specific tasks: e.g. linear algebra, mapping, plotting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessing-python">Accessing Python</h2>

<p>Today We‚Äôll be using a UBC server with python already installed on it.  If you want to install Python on your own computer, check out <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anaconda will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you.</li>
  <li>Anaconda won‚Äôt install <em>every</em> package we‚Äôre using today, but installing new packages is fairly straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-resources">Other resources</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre having issues with Python, a great place to check out is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.  It is a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A related site that is more GIS focused site is <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a></li>

<h2 id="1-start-python">1) Start Python</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UBC provides server space where you can run Python using a <a href="https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter">Jupyter Notebook</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Login with your CWL.  You‚Äôll then be taken to a blank jupyter window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don‚Äôt have to worry about installing anything on your own system.</li>
  <li>This may sound intimidating/confusing.  But don‚Äôt worry, its easy.  You don‚Äôt need to know command line to do this.  I‚Äôll walk you through step by step.
    <ul>
      <li>You can refer to the video below for help</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="2-open-a-terminal">2) Open a terminal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We‚Äôre going to open a command terminal and use command line clone the Github workshop‚Äôs repository.</li>
  <li>In they Jupyter window, click ‚ÄúNew‚Äù in the top right and select ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù from the dropdown menu.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-clone-the-repository">3) Clone the repository</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the new terminal window that opens, paste the command:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git clone https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python/
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This tells Git (a file tracking software) to to download a repository for this workshop with all the files and code.</li>
  <li>Hit enter and the flies will download after a few seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="Git Clone.mp4" target="_blank">Open Video in new tab</a></p>

<h1 id="using-a-jupyter-notebook">Using a Jupyter Notebook</h1>

<p>Go back to your Jupyter Notebook window.  <strong>Don‚Äôt</strong> close the terminal window, we‚Äôll use it again later.  You will notice a folder titled ‚ÄúGeocoding and Webmapping with Python‚Äù, double clicking the folder will open it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You‚Äôll see a two more folders and a collection of files.
    <ul>
      <li>The .ipynb tag on the end denotes a Jupyter ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Notebook is a collection of Python code and annotations that can be run interactively.
    <ul>
      <li>Double click on ‚ÄúGetting Started with Python.ipynb‚Äù to open it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
