<h1 id="accessing-python">Accessing Python</h1>

<p>Today We‚Äôll be using a UBC server with python already installed on it.  If you want to install Python on your own computer, check out <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anaconda will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you.</li>
  <li>Anaconda won‚Äôt install <em>every</em> package we‚Äôre using today, but installing new packages is fairly straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other resources</strong>: If you‚Äôre having issues with Python, a great place to check out is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.  It is a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions.  A related site that is more GIS focused site is <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a></p>

<p><strong>Video Reference</strong>: This video covers the steps incase you get lost.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> <strong>Start a Jupyter Lab</strong></p>

<p>UBC provides server space where you can run Python using <a href="https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter">Jupyter Lab</a>.  Login with your CWL.  You‚Äôll then be taken to a blank jupyter lab.  This is a good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about installing anything on your own system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This may be intimidating, but don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need to know command line to do this.  I‚Äôll walk you through step by step.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> <strong>Open a terminal</strong></p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to open a terminal and use command line clone (‚Äúdownload‚Äù) the Github workshop‚Äôs repository.  In they Jupyter window, click <strong>File¬ªNew</strong> in the top right and select <strong>Terminal</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> <strong>Clone the Repository</strong></p>

<p><strong>clone</strong> tells <strong>git</strong> (a file tracking software) to download a repository (collection of code, data, etc.) for this workshop.  A folder called <strong>Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python</strong> will appear after you clone the repository.  You can explore it using the file viewer on the left, or you can use the command line.  In the new terminal window that opens, paste this command and hit enter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	git clone https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong class="label label-red">4</strong> <strong>Installing a Package</strong></p>

<p><strong>pip</strong> ( package installer for Python) is a tool we can use to install files.  In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the geopy package:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install geopy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong class="label label-red">5</strong>  <strong>Opening a Jupyter Notebook</strong></p>

<p>In the file viewer You will notice a folder with the same name as the repository you just cloned, double clicking the folder will open it.  You‚Äôll see a folders and a collection of files.  The one we‚Äôll be working in is called ‚ÄúPython_Notebooks‚Äù.  Double click to enter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The .ipynb tag on the end denotes a Jupyter ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>A Notebook is a collection of Python code and annotations that can be run interactively.</li>
      <li>Double click on ‚ÄúGetting Started with Python.ipynb‚Äù to open it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="getting-started-with-geocoding">Getting Started with Geocoding</h1>

<p>You can close the terminal window, we don‚Äôt need it anymore.  Go back to your Jupyter Notebook window.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Double click on ‚ÄúGeocoding and Webmapping.ipynb‚Äù to open it.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="an-example-workflow">An Example Workflow</h1>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve gotten an introduction to geocoding and web mapping, we‚Äôll work through a practical application by mapping violence at the hands of Police in BC.  Go back to your Jupyter Lab window, double click on ‚ÄúExample Workflow.ipynb‚Äù to open it.</p>
