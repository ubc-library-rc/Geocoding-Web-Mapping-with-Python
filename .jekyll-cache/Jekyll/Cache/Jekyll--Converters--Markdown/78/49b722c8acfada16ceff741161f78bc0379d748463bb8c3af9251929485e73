<p>The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.  Specifically the xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m (Musqueam), É™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations.  There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-an-acknowledgement">Why Do an Acknowledgement?</h1>

<p>For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe.  In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada.  There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map.  Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.  A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that.  It isnâ€™t just a formality.  It is a time to reflect and build understanding.

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>

<p>What do we mean when we say <strong>traditional</strong>, <strong>ancestral</strong>, and <strong>unceded territory</strong>?  It is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and coven the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism.</p>

<h3 id="traditional"><strong>Traditional</strong></h3>

<p>Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied.

<h3 id="ancestral"><strong>Ancestral</strong></h3>

<p>Recognizes territories and cultures have been handed down from generation to generation.  One example is language, which has strong connections to ancestry.  The xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m and É™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬ speak dialects of <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/">Hulâ€™qâ€™umiâ€™numâ€™ / Halqâ€™emÃ©ylem / hÉ™nÌ“qÌ“É™minÌ“É™mÌ“</a> and the SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh speak <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/">Sá¸µwxÌ±wÃº7mesh snÃ­chim</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unceded"><strong>Unceded</strong></h3>

<p>Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement.  Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty.  Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home.  Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty.  This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were â€œcededâ€ by treaty.  Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation.  The <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1">RCMP</a> was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.</p>
