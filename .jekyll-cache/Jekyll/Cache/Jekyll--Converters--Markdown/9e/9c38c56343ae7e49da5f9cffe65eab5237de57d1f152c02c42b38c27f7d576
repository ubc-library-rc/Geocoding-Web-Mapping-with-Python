<h1 id="content-warning">Content Warning</h1>

<p>This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.  We are going to use a dataset of police killings and police involved deaths in Canada.  The intent behind choosing this dataset end goal of this workshop is to show that GIS, programming, data analysis, and data visualization can be powerful tools for promoting social and environmental justice issues.</p>

<h1 id="why-police-involved-deaths-in-canada">Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?</h1>

<p>Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873.  Police play a central tool in Canada‚Äôs ongoing genocide of Indigenous people and they work to maintain systems of oppression throughout in Canadian society.  Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is ‚Äújust an American issue‚Äù and that Canada is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-on-terminology">Notes on Terminology</h2>

<p><strong>Police Killing:</strong> A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.</p>

<p><strong>Police-Involved Deaths</strong>  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.</p>

<h2 id="increasing-police-violence-in-canada">Increasing Police Violence in Canada</h2>

<p>There has been an <a href="https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/#increasing-police-violence-in-canada">increasing trend</a> in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years.  This may be partly an result of greater access to information, but it is also likely that Canadian Police <em>are</em> becoming more violent.</p>

# Territorial Acknowledgement


UBC and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.  Specifically the x ∑m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì…ôm (Musqueam), …ôlÃìilw…ôta…Å…¨ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxw√∫7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations.

## Why Do a Territorial Acknowledgement?

For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe.  In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada.  There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map.  Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.  A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that.  It isn't just a formality.  It is a time to reflect and build understanding.  The maps and information presented below are sourced from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).  

## What Does it Mean?

Why do we say *traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory*?

**Traditional**: recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied.  The [x ∑m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì…ôm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), and […ôlÃìilw…ôta…Å…¨](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), [Skwxw√∫7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/)Nations have traditionally occupied this area.

**Ancestral**: recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.  It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land.  Language has strong connections to ancestry.  The x ∑m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì…ôm and …ôlÃìilw…ôta…Å…¨ speak dialects of [Hul‚Äôq‚Äôumi‚Äônum‚Äô / Halq‚Äôem√©ylem / h…ônÃìqÃì…ôminÃì…ômÃì](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxw√∫7mesh-ulh speak [S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh sn√≠chim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/).

**Unceded**: refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.  Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty.
