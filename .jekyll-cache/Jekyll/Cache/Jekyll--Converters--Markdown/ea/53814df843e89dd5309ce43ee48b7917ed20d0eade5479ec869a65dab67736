<p>Now that we‚Äôve gotten an introduction to geocoding and web mapping, lets see how one might use it in practice.  Take this scenario:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are a GIS analyst working with a non-profit in Toronto and you‚Äôve been asked to put together a map highlighting the racial disparities in police violence at the hands of Police in BC.  The map needs to be interactive and compatible with mobile devices.  The non-profit has a limited budget, they can‚Äôt afford an expensive ESRI license to use ArcMap Online.  Leaflet maps are the ideal solution here, they‚Äôre free and effective.</li>
  <li>A dataset is available with demographics data describing the victims.  However many incomplete records, the police refuse to release information identifying the victims in many cases.  The data also has the addresses where the incidents occurred.  To compensate for this, you decide to add census data to the map to show the demographics of the populations where the incidents are occurring.</li>
</ul>
