Immigration officials held him for more than nine hours before he made it to the airport reception area where he hoped his mother was waiting, but she had been told he had not arrived. Dziekanski began throwing furniture, and four RCMP officers shocked him with a Taser five times before handcuffing him. Dziekanski lost consciousness and did not receive CPR until paramedics arrived 15 minutes later. One of the officers was sentenced to 30 months in prison for perjury.;    ""Tasered multiple times and subsequently restrained by RCMP Officers.""; ; Unknown; Unknown; ""exhibiting behaviours that might best be described as agitated and flustrated"";    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>On Monday, October 30, 2017, The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed appeals from killer Mounties Kwesi Millington and Benjamin (Monty) Robinson who had been convicted of perjury in connection with the killing of Robert Dziekanski at the Vancouver airport in 2007. The two Mounties were among four RCMP officers charged with perjury following a public inquiry into the killing of Mr. Dziekanski, a traveler from Poland who was tased multiple times in the arrivals area of the airport. Millington was sentenced to 30 months in prison while Robinson was sentenced to two years less a day, one year of probation, and 240 hours of community service.</p>
<p>The Dziekanski killing put on display clearly the culture of deception and lies that marks Canadian policing in general and the RCMP in particular and was infused with lies through and through. The RCMP spokesperson initially proclaimed publicly that Mr. Dziekanski was acting aggressively toward officers, not complying, and apparently drunk. All of these claims against the victim were shown to be lies when a civilian video of the encounter appeared showing that, in fact, Mr. Dziekanski did not confront officers aggressively and appeared to be following their orders (despite a language barrier as none of the officers spoke Polish). RCMP had taken the video from the videographer and attempted to keep it from being released publicly.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected the appeals immediately after hearing them. Because they ruled from the bench, formal reasons for their decision were not immediately available.</p>
       *<p>Benjamin “Monty” Robinson the RCMP officer who has killed two people, most infamously Robert Dziekanski on October 14, 2007, has lost the appeal of his conviction for perjury in that case. The panel of Appeal Court judges in British Columbia upheld a lower court’s decision that found Robinson lied during a public inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of Robert Dziekanski. In the majority decision Justice Mary Newbury wrote:</p>
<p>“The judge’s findings cannot in my view be said to have been unreasonable. I have little doubt that ‘viewed through the lens of judicial experience,’ the appellant had a ‘clear reason and motive to deny’ that he and his colleagues had discussed the incident and colluded in their evidence before the inquiry. The court was not left with any reasonable doubt on this point.”</p>
<p>Robinson had been sentenced to two years less a day for perjury in that case.</p>
<p>The Dziekanski killing gained international attention and shone a light on practices of public deception and lying in the RCMP. Robinson was the senior of four officers who confronted 40-year-old Robert Dziekanski in the Vancouver International Airport where the Polish traveller who spoke no English had been left without support for almost 10 hours in the arrivals terminal. RCMP almost immediately upon encountering Dziekanski used a taser on the man multiple times before pinning him to the ground causing his death on the scene. RCMP public spokespeople initially said Dziekanski had been irate and aggressive during the encounter and suggested he was drunk. The phony “excited delirium” claim was even suggested. Until the civilian video surfaced showing that in fact Dziekanski was compliant with officers, did not threaten them, and was in fact moving in the direction they suggested. The RCMP had clearly lied to the public in an effort to frame Dziekanski for his own death (a common endeavor in police killings).</p>
<p>The public display of deception by RCMP prompted the inquiry at which Robinson and fellow officer Kwesi Millington were found to have perjured themselves by colluding and then lying on testimony. Millington lost his appeal in a unanimous decision in July 2016.</p>
<p>Robinson would go on to kill 21-year-old Orion Hutchinson hitting the young motorcyclist with his SUV on October 28, 2008. His two children were in the vehicle at the time. In that case Robinson was convicted of obstruction of justice. It was found that the Mountie had used his police training to avoid charges of impaired driving by claiming that after the crash he went home and drank two shots of vodka to “calm his nerves” (a police ploy to cover drinking before the crash). The court heard that he had bragged to party guests that his training gave him a way to deal with drunk driving charges. Robinson was given a conditional sentence of 12 months in that case.</p>
<p>The fact remains that RCMP officer Monty Robinson killed two civilians. He has not been charged or held accountable for those killings.</p>

According to an IIO media release, Prince George RCMP arrested the victim on July 18 after responding to calls about a man allegedly looking at vehicles in a parking lot on the 1000 block of Central Street West at about 10:30 PM. Several police arrived on the scene. The person targeted by an officer was arrested after an alleged struggle with police in which the victim was pepper sprayed and put in the back of a police car. At some point it was noticed that the man appeared to be having trouble breathing and an ambulance was called. The victim supposedly collapsed when removed from the police car. He was pronounced dead at the hospital a bit after midnight. None of the released details have been independently confirmed. Neither has it been confirmed that the man arrested was the man about whom the initial call to police was made.</p>
       <p>The man who died while in custody of Prince George RCMP has been identified publicly as Dale Culver, a 35-year-old father of three. Several RCMP officers took part in Culver’s arrest allegedly following a call about someone looking at vehicles. Culver was pepper prayed and newly released video shows that four officers pinned him to the ground afterwards.</p>
<p>It has not been independently confirmed that Culver, or anyone else was “casing vehicles.” Yet on this basis he was killed by police. A terrible price to pay for simply being suspected of possibly looking at cars.</p>
<p>Seeing the video, Alicia Wisla, Culver’s partner and mother of their five-month-old child, insists the officers involved must be charged.</p>

       ***<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia has decided not to recommend charges against an RCMP officer who shot a 24-year-old in Port Hardy on Vancouver Island on July 8, 2015. The IIO suggested that the man made threatening comments to people and carried a small knife. There is no explanation for the total of five shots fired into the youth by the officer. The killer cop did not provide a statement to the IIO.</p>
       *<p>The British Columbia C Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) has raised questions of “racial bias” and excessive force by RCMP officers in the arrest of Dale Culver (35) of the Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan First Nations who died in custody following the arrest in July 2017. In an official complaint filed January 16, 2018, to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, the BCCLA also claims that the RCMP in Prince George, BC, told witnesses to delete video footage of the Culver arrest. According to police reports, Culver complained of shortness of breath after arrest and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Culver’s cousin, Debbie Pierre, said she was not informed of his death until 24 hours later. She then found video footage of the arrest posted on social media. In her words: “It was horrific” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The family had questions about Culver’s death and contacted the BCCLA to get some answers.</p>
<p>Police reports suggest the RCMP responded to a call about a man allegedly “casing vehicles.” This claim has not been independently confirmed nor has it been explained what that assumption was based on by caller or police. Police struggled with Culver physically.</p>
<p>It is reported that pepper spray used in Culver’s arrest. When he was put in the back of a police vehicle he appeared to have difficulty breathing. An ambulance was called and Culver collapsed when taken out of the police car. He was pronounced dead in hospital a bit after midnight on July 19, 2017.</p>
<p>According to executive director Josh Paterson, BCCLA has spoken with “a number of people, including eyewitnesses” who allege RCMP instructed people to delete video footage of the arrest (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The association questions whether “explicit or  implicit racial  bias” played a role in the encounter and arrest. BCCLA says it has been told there were “several hours” between the initial call to police and the arrival of RCMP on the scene (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). This raises obvious questions about Culver was approached and, specifically, whether it was because he was Indigenous.</p>
<p>In the words of the BCCLA complaint:</p>
<p>“We question on what information or basis the member or members of the RCMP began their interaction or questioning of Mr. Culver, and/or a request to identify himself, in the first place.” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018)</p>
<p>Debbie Pierre is left with the same question. In her words: “Was Dale targeted because of Dale or was he targeted because of his being Indigenous” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018).</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO) is also investigating, as it does in cases of police harm to civilians in the province. IIO chief civilian director Ron MacDonald says the IIO was independently aware of allegations of witnesses being told to delete video footage. He also said the IIO was aware of questions regardding police use of force and the timing of Culver’s arrest.</p>
<p>Culver had three children, the eldest of whom is now 14.</p>

       *<p>The man who died while in custody of Prince George RCMP has been identified publicly as Dale Culver, a 35-year-old father of three. Several RCMP officers took part in Culver’s arrest allegedly following a call about someone looking at vehicles. Culver was pepper prayed and newly released video shows that four officers pinned him to the ground afterwards.</p>
<p>It has not been independently confirmed that Culver, or anyone else was “casing vehicles.” Yet on this basis he was killed by police. A terrible price to pay for simply being suspected of possibly looking at cars.</p>
<p>Seeing the video, Alicia Wisla, Culver’s partner and mother of their five-month-old child, insists the officers involved must be charged.</p>

       ***<p>An Edmonton police officer shot and killed a man during a traffic stop on the afternoon of March 9, 2017. Police claim that the officer, a six year veteran of the force, was dispatched to the Holland Landing area in southwest Edmonton in response to two 911 calls about a driver swerving on the road. Police also claim the vehicle was pulled over at 1:43 PM. It was during this stop that the police officer discharged his firearm hitting and killing the victim who was declared dead at the scene. There has been no independent confirmation of any of the information reported by police. Few details have been made available to the public and the name of the victim has not been released. The names of officers who kill civilians are rarely released publicly and even then typically only in instances where charges are laid.</p>
<p>The case has been turned over to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team which investigates instances of police harm to civilians in Alberta.</p>
       ***<p>A disturbingly high number of civilians in Canada are killed by police officers who are speeding or driving recklessly. In most of those cases they are doing so without cause even on their own broad terms. Such was the case on March 8, 2012 when a speeding Constable Chris Luimes crashed his vehicle into a car driven by 84-year-old Annie Walden, killing her. This assessment comes from a senior officer, Brad Doucette, testifying at a fatality inquiry into the killing of Annie Walden which took place on March 14, 2017, an incredible five years after the fact. The inquiry which was scheduled for two days was completed in under three hours. Only two witnesses were called.</p>
<p>Constable Luimes was driving an unmarked police car at nearly 120 kilometers an hour to what was a non-emergency call. The speed limit on the road on which he was traveling was only 50 km/h. His car smashed into the Volkswagen Jetta driven by Annie Walden on 75th Street turning onto 76th Avenue. Walden died at the scene</p>
<p>Of course a civilian traveling at a rate of speed so much over the limit would be dealt with harshly. Let alone the response if they actually killed someone while doing so. Such is not the case where police speed and/or drive recklessly and kill a civilian. Luimes was charged with dangerous driving but once again a judge moved to ensure the killer officer would be taken good care of. The judge, stunningly, ruled that there was no enough evidence to convict the officer, despite a woman killed by his actions and the fact that he had no justifiable reason for driving the way he did, even by the low police department standards of the day.</p>
<p>One week ago, Luimes was found guilty of discreditable conduct in the incident during a police disciplinary hearing. Incredibly, the outcome was that he was ordered to participate in a video that will be used as part of mandatory police training. Constable Luimes still works with the Edmonton police force.</p>

An ASIRT report absolved the officer who killed Stephens of any wrongdoing. ;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Canada have their origins as a colonial military force. Their history is one of settlerism and class domination on an ongoing basis. They continue in the present to police and regulate and repress Indigenous communities through targeted violence. This must be remembered in any case of RCMP contact with Indigenous people and communities in Canada.</p>
<p>Alberta RCMP shot and killed Ralph Stephens, 27, on the Stoney Nakoda First Nation near Morley on Saturday, January 7, 2017. Stephens died in hospital about and hour after being shot. Police claim they were on the reserve to execute a warrant for first-degree murder charges related to the death of Lorenzo “Billy” Bearspaw, also 27, whose body was found on the reserve on January 6 after he was reported missing on January 3 by a family member. The other men pursued by RCMP, John Stephens, 29, and Deangelo Powderface, 22, have both been taken into custody by the force. John Stephens was arrested directly prior to the killing of Ralph Stephens. Major Crimes with assistance from the RCMP Emergency Response Team were involved.</p>
<p>No one has said why police opened fire on the victim. Nothing has been reported to suggest he confronted or attacked police. Police have only said that Ralph Stephens “engaged police” but this has not been corroborated by any independent sources or witnesses. Several people were said to be in the residence at which Stephens was killed when the shooting happened.</p>
<p>The dangerous nature of this police action and the prospect it will stoke justified anger toward RCMP are clear. Police seem concerned with dampening any response. Chief Superintendent Tony Hamori, the officer in charge of Southern Alberta made an appeal with no note of accountability or reasons for adherence: “I also urge calm in the community while the investigations take place” (quoted by Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>Community members describe a chaotic scene after police arrived on the scene. According to Gerald Powderface, a relative of Ralph Stephens: “My family told me it happened so quick, even my cousin was asking them ‘Have you shot my boy?’ They didn’t even answer him, they just dragged him out of the house without no shoes and they&#8217;re throwing people out of the house left and right. They didn’t even answer his question, ‘Have you shot my boy? What happened, what’s going on here?’” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The community has come to the family’s care and support. According to Gerald Powderface: We have a community here that support each other on every matter, especially a matter like that. They all come to the house. There was a lot of people there last night when I left” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the RCMP actions in killing Ralph Stephens. RCMP continue to maintain an active presence on the reserve since the shooting.</p>
<p>Whatever one might think about this particular case the fact remains that an historic settler colonial force built on dispossession, expropriation, and genocide continues to police Indigenous communities across Canada.</p>

The Special Investigations Unit determined no charges would be laid against the officers. ;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       ***<p>Suicide by cop is a dubious designation, one of those excuses police apply to justify publicly their actions when they kill civilians. The notion is dubious for a number of reasons. First, it is applied after the fact in a range of diverse circumstances including those where the victim has not expressed suicidal wishes (or on the contrary is even happy in life) or is not posing a threat to anyone. Do not forget that the police attempted to use this defense to protect killer cop James Forcillo who shot Sammy Yatim multiple times while the youth was alone in an empty street car. Second, even if someone wishes to “die by cop” does not mean that the police are justified in killing them or should be expected to kill them. It speaks volumes that anyone could expect with probability that an encounter with police would end with the police taking their life. Third, if someone is experiencing mental health issues, the police are not the appropriate response and if they are called for such issues health care providers should be involved rather than police ready to shoot to kill. Fourth, in suicide the person takes the decision and acts. In “suicide by cop” the cops can choose not to shoot and kill the person. Someone is taking the active decision to kill you in a case where they could choose not to. Finally, “suicide by cop” should never be applied as a justification for police killing civilians as it is now. The facts of each encounter matter.</p>
<p>These are all issues to keep in mind when details emerge of the killing by Nunavut RCMP of a 39-year-old man in Hall Beach, in the Qikiqtaaluk region of Nunavut, a town with a population of about 750. RCMP encountered the man over the evening of Monday, May 1 and Tuesday, May 2, 2017. Police claim they were alerted to the man around 11:30 PM after receiving a call about an online Facebook live video in which the man ranted about “suicide by cops.” The man is alone and crying in the video. Police promptly attended the house where the man was present, by himself, and shot and  killed him.</p>
<p>This is the third killing of a civilian by police since December 2016 in the small northern territory. As in other recent cases in which Nunavut RCMP have killed a civilian, the Ottawa Police Service will carry out the investigation into their fellow police officers. This is in no way an independent investigation and as in all cases of police “investigating” police lacks all credibility.</p>

The gun turned out to be a pellet gun.       *<p>Greg Ritchie, a 30-year-old Ojibwe man from Saugeen First Nation near Owen Sound, Ontario, has been identified as the man shot and killed by Ottawa police on January 31. Family members have spoken publicly to say he was experiencing mental health crises and was heading to a pharmacy to pick up medication when he was shot and killed by police. The responding officers have been identified as Ottawa constables Thanh Tran and Daniel Vincelette. Witnesses have reported hearing more than two shots. Tran is a repeat offender. He and another officer had been charged, in September 2011, with assault causing bodily harm following the arrest of an intoxicated 50-year-old homeless man.</p>
<p>Family members say Ritchie, who had been taken from his mother and placed in foster care, had struggled with mental health issues from a young age. He had moved to Ottawa to live with his brother and his partner. Ritchie’s sister-in-law reports that he was in good spirits the morning he was killed, having received his Ontario Disability Support Program payment and going out for a coffee. He then set out to get his medication, suffering a headache and recovering from a concussion. He had been a customer at the pharmacy at Elmvale Acres Mall since arriving in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Police allegedly received a call about a “suspicious incident.” This is a painfully poignant description given that Ritchie’s family says he had an ongoing fear that people viewed him suspiciously because of the way he looked and because of his Indigenous identity.</p>
<p>In the words of his sister-in-law, Chantel Ritchie:</p>
<p>“And the thing is, that’s not the kind of guy he is. He gets scared…and that’s the saddest part. We know that he was in complete and utter terror in a moment like that. He’s scared of just going into a grocery store…of just being in a crowd, because he’s afraid that people want to do something to him or don’t like him because of the way he looks.</p>
<p>“And honestly, we’ve seen it. People just take one look and that’s it. He’s First Nations, he’s been homeless before, and he is afraid. People just take all of that in one look and then make assumptions and then act on it. And it just really hurts that we weren&#8217;t there to be able to calm him down because there’s no way that any of this would have happened if we were there. There&#8217;s no way.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>Chantal Ritchie says Greg Ritchie felt better around family and was very involved in learning about his culture. She worries that cultural materials he carried with him might have been misinterpreted as weapons by the police who killed him. In her words:</p>
<p>“I could tell right away he suffered from mental illness, but when he was around family he was very happy. He was very into his culture and learning about his ancestors. He did sometimes exhibit that he feels the pain of what happened to his people…but he was just happy to be around family and to be at powwows and helping at those events.</p>
<p>“He was sometimes hired to keep sacred fires going at ceremonies, and spent time in woods and rivers looking for arrowheads. It also comforted him to recreate arrowheads and other artifacts.</p>
<p>“Those things he keeps on his person because it makes him feel safe. We always tell him, don’t bring it with you anywhere, because we were afraid of this very thing happening.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>One witness, Shireen Moodley, reports hearing multiple rapid-fire gunshots</p>

February 1. <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-fatal-police-shooting-family-1.5000285"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-fatal-police-shooting-family-1.5000285</a></p>
       *<p>There used to be an old saying, “Help the police, beat yourself up.” Now Michael Edelson, the lawyer for killer Ottawa cop Daniel Montsion, wants a court and the public to believe that the vicious beating his client inflicted on 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi had nothing to do with killing him. Instead, he suggests Abdi died of a heart attack. And he apparently wants people to believe that, even if he did have a heart attack, a severe beating with baton by police did not play a part in it. So, according to copagandist Edelson, Abdi is responsible for his own death: not the brutal assault he was subjected to. Maybe he beat himself to death.</p>
<p>Edelson made these absurd and offensive claims in an attempt to move up the court date for officer Montsion. According to audio court transcripts from the October 20 hearing, Edelson suggested: “This is not a beating that caused the death of Mr. Abdi. Mr. Abdi died of a heart attack. That’s what killed him.” Montsion has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in the killing of Abdi in July 2016.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s request to move the trial date was denied. The 12-week trial remains scheduled to start in February 2019, which is almost three years after Abdi’s killing.</p>
       *<p>Observant commentators have suggested that police actually operate like a gang, closing ranks unquestioningly to support their own no matter how egregious the member’s actions may have been. While there is some truth in this, police are not quite like gangs in that they lack the honor of gangs who at least have some limits, some acts they will not tolerate among members. If anyone needs a case in point they need only look at the dubious activities of the Ottawa Police Association and Ottawa police officers in response to the killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a Somalian-Canadian man suffering mental distress who was beaten to death by Constable Daniel Montsion in July of 2016. Montsion had previously expressed a problem with a suspect who was Somalian.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 29, 2017, the first day of preliminary court procedures leading to Montsion’s trial for manslaughter, several Ottawa police officers wore blue and black rubber wristbands stating “United We Stand #1998.” The number printed on the band is actually Montsion’s badge number. The rubber band bracelets are being sold for $2 apiece with the money going to the Ottawa Police Association.</p>
<p>This open show of support for a killer cop whose brutal beating of the defenseless man was partly caught on video is a tasteless and provocative move in a context that is already heated and where community members have mobilized against racist policing. It is an arrogant move that is clearly an attempt to put pressure on the court even as police say they do not comment on cases before the courts.</p>
<p>Incredibly the cops are using the excuse that it is a measure to address the trauma officers face on the job. This is part of a growing campaign to pose police crimes as primarily being about traumas for officers who then need more public money and resources for support. Some paid “criminologists” are being mustered to lend a veneer of credibility to the trauma money appeals led by police associations. Those same bought “criminologists” show little to no regard for the victims of police violence.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice for Abdirahman Abdi campaign, William Felepchuk, calls the bracelets an “outrage.” He notes that the nature of the crime Monsion is accused of is severe and suggest the move is an interference in the criminal justice process. Felepchuk further notes that police would not be so welcoming of civilians wearing such arm bands in cases of someone accused of killing a police officer.</p>
<p>Police always have pressures, both overt like the arm bands and covert like implied non-cooperation with prosecution, to apply on broader criminal justice processes. One should not expect anything resembling justice from the state in its dealings with killer cops.</p>
       *<p>The killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year old Somali Canadian man, by Ottawa Police Constable Daniel Montsion on July 24, 2016, was a particularly vicious and brutal affair which sparked community outrage and a community movement for “Justice for Abdirahman.” Montsion repeatedly delivered heavy baton blows to the defenseless man. On Monday March 6, 2017 Ontario’s police oversight agency, the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) brought three charges against Constable Montsion: manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon. Laying of charges against police officers who kill civilians is a too rare outcome in Canada.</p>
<p>The lethal beating of Abdi, a man struggling with mental health issues, while neighbors called out for the officers to stop was partially caught on video. Neighbors looked out for Abdi who was well known in the community and informed officers of his mental health issues and likely fear and lack of understanding of police commands. They implored officers to back off the frightened man but the assault with baton persisted. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the following day but family members say hospital officials told them the man was dead forty-five minutes before he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is a member of the Ottawa police direct action response team (DART) which targets gang but was assisting on patrol when he killed Abdi. Montsion has been on desk duty throughout the investigation and is now scheduled to appear at the Ontario court of justice in Ottawa on March 29. A second officer, Constable Dave Weir was involved in the assault on Abdi but the SIU concluded he was only a witness officer.</p>
<p>As reported previously by killercopscanada Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having a history of violence against Somali-Canadians. By his own admission he had “panicked” when faced with a suspect of Somali background in a case that might also have included the planting of evidence by police.</p>
<p>The police assault on Abdi began with a 911 call from a Bridgehead coffee shop in Abdi’s neighborhood in Ottawa. What happened there is still unclear but owner Tracey Clark says Abdi had made some customers feel uncomfortable or harassed. In her words:</p>
<p>“He would stand and stare at customers, or get a little bit too close, and we were beginning to hear from customers that it was making them feel uncomfortable. And so we had started to have those conversations where, ‘Are you aware of this behaviour, could we ask you not to do that?’ So there were some interventions like that that had taken place.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>After leaving the coffee shop Abdi apparently attempted to return to his apartment three blocks away. On the way he was intercepted by police. One witness, Ross McGhie reports that Abdi appeared fearful of receiving baton blows from the officer who clearly held a baton, and as a result picked up a piece of foam from the street (Nease and Pritchard 2017). He held it over his head in a defensive, not offensive, posture.</p>
<p>At some point, at the corner of Wellington and Hilda streets near Abdi’s apartment, the first officer tried to grab Abdi who dropped the foam and tried to run to his apartment building on Hilda Street. The officer prevented this by striking Abdi a few times on his legs, arms and upper body according to the witness Ross McGhie (Rease and Pritchard 2017). The officer also shouted at the stricken man.</p>
<p>At that point a second officer, said to be Constable Montsion, arrived on scene in a cruiser. He apparently moved very quickly and aggressively against the victim. In the words of McGhie: “The officer emerged from that car very rapidly &#8230; pulled up right in front of the building &#8230; immediately jumped into the altercation and administered a number of very heavy blows to the head and face and neck of Mr. Abdi” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family lawyer Lawrence Greenspon noted that family members had to endure much during the lengthy SIU investigation. In his words:</p>
<p>“It’s been extremely difficult. You not only have the incredible grief that we really can’t understand unless we go through it ourselves, and I don’t wish that on anybody. You have this grief of losing a son, brother, and it’s magnified … the public light has been shining on this death, this tragedy, for eight months now.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 20017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenspon said that the family would likely be pursuing a civil lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>The SIU report is with Ontario&#8217;s attorney general, at present Ottawa Centre Member of  Provincial Parliament Yasir Naqvi but it is not clear if Naqvi will make the report public or not. This has been a case of great public interest and concern. More than is often the case in situations involving police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi was the focus of important public mobilizations and campaigns, including mobilizations of “Black Lives Matter.” Large demonstrations calling for “Justice for Abdirahman” were held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. #justiceforabdirahman gained much attention on social media.</p>

Police were aware that Taqqaugaq had schizophrenia and was susceptible to delusions. When police arrived Taqqaugaq came outside to talk with them, but the incident escalated when he refused to be handcuffed and one of the officers fired a stun gun that failed. Taqqaugaq retreated into the home and returned with a knife, chasing the officers. One of the officers shot him mulitple times, and Taqqaugaq died at hospital. No charges were laid in the incident.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       *<p>It is rare in the Canadian context that police officers who kill civilians are ever named publicly. This generally only happens in the few cases that result in charges laid against police or in case of a public inquiry or inquest. With the coroner’s inquest onto the police killing of Felix Taqqaugaq on March 20, 2012, mandatory in cases of police harm to civilians in Nunavut, the RCMP officers who killed him have been identified publicly as Constable Jason Trites and Sergeant Peter Marshall.</p>
<p>Constable Trites knew that Taqqaugaq was dealing with mental health issues, which the officer understood to be schizophrenia, yet he still moved quickly to arrest the man for supposedly uttering threats and fired a taser at him only moments into the encounter (and before the man had done anything more than speak to officers). The taser fire may have upset Taqqaugaq who was then chased back into his house by Sergeant Marshall. In response to this police chase Taqqaugaq may have returned brandishing a knife.</p>
<p>By Trite’s own admission he tripped (apparently in a panic) while backing away from Taqqaugaq and firing his handgun. This left Trites with a self-inflicted wound to his hand. This injury was initially reported publicly but it was not clarified that Trites had shot himself. Such early reports of officer injuries, without the information that the injuries are self-inflicted, can give the impression that police were physically threatened or harmed and thus justified in using lethal force. A similarly deceptive mention of injury to an officer (that later was identified as officer-inflicted) was given in the RCMP killing of Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia. While on his back Trites shot Taqqaugaq three times. The man was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>According to Mary Ijjangiaq, Taqqaugaq’s partner of 13 years the police instigated the situation that led to the killing. In her words to the inquest: “They ganged up on him. He was deliberately provoked. I think [the officer] deliberately made sure he died” (quoted in Murray 2016a). She says the victim held a knife at his chest not over his head in a threatening manner as police claim.</p>
<p>Police audio from the incident raise further questions and ppint to a very quick escalation to lethal force by police. From the moment that officers radioed in to the Iqaluit command centre reporting they had located the suspect only 60 seconds passed before one officer called out “Shots fired; suspect down” (Murray 2016a).</p>
<p>As cops typically do in such cases officer Trites has attempted to present himself as the victim requiring sympathy. In his pitch to the inquiry he attempts to make the family feel sorry for himself: “I just hope the family knows that they’re not the only ones that were hurt by this. The things that I deal with, do affect my personal life. I’m definitely not the same person as I used to be before this incident” (quoted in Murray 2016b).</p>
<p>Incredibly both Constable Trites and Sergeant Marshall were flown out of the northern community (where the RCMP is a still colonial force) the very next day after the killing of Felix Taqqaugaq. Trites has testified at the inquest by video from Halifax.</p>

       *<p>Police should not be called to address people dealing with mental health issues. Yet too often they are. In the Canadian context this results disproportionately in killings of civilians experiencing mental health distress by police. This is true in communities large and small, rural and urban. It occurs in southern cities and northern communities like Igloolik, Nunavut.</p>
<p>More than four years ago RCMP in Igloolik shot and killed Felix Taqqaugaq (29) in his own home only moments after encountering the man. The March 20, 2012 killing occurred after Taqqaugaq called into a local radio station and engaged in something of a wordy rant. For some reason a listener decided to call the RCMP about the man. RCMP encountered the victim at his home and killed him.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 1, 2016 a coroner’s inquest into the killing of Taqqaugaq by police began. Nunavut Chief Coroner Padma Suramala will carry out the inquest, which will run until November 11. Findings from an earlier investigation by the Ottawa Police Service will be addressed.</p>
<p>Family members have noted that Felix Taqqaugaq experienced mental health issues. It remains unclear why anyone would call police upon hearing someone ranting on a radio progam.</p>

Police claim they encountered a conflict when responding to a report of a stabbing. They say one officer was stabbed after police became involved. The 33-year-old victim was shot by an officer and taken to Health Sciences Centre but died. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed. There have been three shootings of civilians by police in Winnipeg in the past three months alone.</p>
       *<p>On Tuesday, April 24, 2018, two inquests were called into separate police killings of civilians in Manitoba which happened within a week and a half of each other in September 2017. The chief medical examiner in Manitoba has called an inquest into the police shooting and killing of 23-year-old Adrian Lacquette of Winnipeg on September 13. Manitoba Justice announced a separate inquest into the shootings and killings of 33-year-old Evan Grant Caron, who was fatally shot by police 10 days after the shooting of Adrian Lacquette.</p>
<p>Both victims were Indigenous men. This fact is reflective of the colonial and racist violence of policing in Manitoba (and Canada more broadly). At least 11 of the known 19 people killed by police in Manitoba between 2000 and 2017 were identified as Indigenous.</p>
<p>The inquests cannot assign blame or lead to arrests and police are under no obligation to follow any recommendations that might result from either inquest.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Justice will also appoint what it calls an independent observer to oversee the investigation, but such observers are almost always former police officers, so in no way independent. Justice Ministry spokesman Drew Wilby explained at a news conference that in cases were an independent observer is requested, the ministry appoints someone such as a former police officer. Yet, Wilby suggested, incredulously, that, “This individual will not be connected to the RCMP.” But it could well be a fellow officer so no claims of independence have any credibility.</p>

The independent investigation into her death last year is ongoing, but preliminary reports from the investigation say police were first called to a home about a ‚Äúdangerous situation.‚Äù Three officers arrived on the scene and almost two hours later, Sellars would be killed by a non-police issued gun.       ***<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is examining the death of a 26-year-old man following an interaction with police in Cambridge, Ontario. Paramedics were apparently called to a home near Cedar Street and Southgate Road on the evening of Monday, May 22, 2017. At around 8:20 PM police attended the scene and sometime after their arrival the man was unresponsive. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Details of the man’s death have not been released publicly, including the reason why police were called to the site.</p>
       ***<p>Based on the outcomes of several recent coroners’ inquests and investigations by oversight agencies it appears that the “suicide by cop” excuse is being used to let killer cops off the hook in various jurisdictions in Canada. It is becoming a “go to” justification for killer cops. The numerous problems with this bogus conclusion have been outlined in several reports for this project.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario added to the suicide by cop chorus legitimizing police killings of civilians in the case of the killing of 21-year-old Alex Wettlaufer by Toronto Police on March 13, 2016. Wettlaufer was shot three times while isolated in the Villaways Park in North York after a lengthy standoff in which it seems clear police had multiple opportunities to use non-lethal means and/or have a health care provider attend.</p>
<p>Two 911 calls apparently made by Wettlaufer suggested he needed health care assistance. Yet no health care personnel were dispatched to the scene. Only police. And they waited for the Toronto Police Emergency Task Force (ETF) to arrive. Wettlaufer was said to be holding a cell phone and a BB gun.</p>
<p>The claim of suicide by cop is especially dubious in this case given that on at least one occasion during the interaction with police Wettlaufer tried to get away by fleeing into the woods at Villaways Park. Police pursued him seemingly cornering him. By the SIU’s own account Wettlauufer even put down his BB gun several times. During the standoff the young man was alone on a bridge in the park. It is not clear that he posed any threat to the public at that time. By the SIU account, ETF had taken cover in the woods, being able to see Wettlaufer isolated and alone on the bridge. He was also apparently on his cellphone with 911 and expressing his distress during the standoff. And still no health care providers were deployed. So police, in positions of cover, shoot a distressed youth, on the phone with 911, who is alone on a bridge, and who has repeatedly set his BB gun down. And this is “suicide by cop.” The leap of logic by SIU director Tony Loparco is perplexing. In his conclusion: “ “Given that Mr. Wettlaufer was no doubt aware that he had a mere BB gun in hand, his actions lead me to the conclusion that he was attempting to bait the police into fatally shooting him by creating a perilous situation.” Quite a claim.</p>
<p>The three officers who killed Wettlaufer did not participate in the investigation as is their right under the limited and insufficient oversight rules. The investigation took fourteen months despite the SIU goalpost of 120 days.</p>
<p>As a  result of the SIU report no charges will be laid against the three officers who opened fire on Wettlaufer.</p>

The Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) officer was in an unmarked police cruiser, tailing a suspect at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, when he struck and killed Nicholas Thorne-Belance in Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>In a ruling issued Thursday, July 19, 2018, in Longueuil, Quebec court Judge Éric Simard concluded there was nothing to justify the speed at which Ouellet was driving and that there were “inherent” risks in that activity.</p>
<p>Wrote Simard in his decision: “His failure to take steps to avoid such risks constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation would follow” (quoted in Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet reached a speed of 134 km/h on Gaétan-Boucher Boulevard in the period before the accident — and 108 km/h at the moment of impact. At the intersection of Gaétan-Boucher and Davis, Ouellet struck a vehicle carrying two children in the backseat. Nicholas Thorne-Belance was critically injured and died in hospital five days later (Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet had tried to claim in trial that the crash was unavoidable. The Crown argued that the driving was “objectively dangerous.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, the Crown had initially decided to not lay charges. That decision was only reversed in 2015 after Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid growing community outcry. The first inclination of the state is always to protect the state. Community mobilization can affect that.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for October 22, 2018. Convictions for dangerous driving causing death carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. We will see if a killer cop gets anything near that.</p>

On July 20, 2017 the coroner’s inquest into his killing by police was released and concluded incredibly that his death was accidental. Now for most reasonable people if a civilian pepper sprayed, beat, restrained, and stepped on someone and they died it would not be viewed as an accident. Death would be recognized as a probability outcome of those actions being inflicted on someone.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station, in the community 400 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, concerned about shortness of breath and looking for help. A nurse there viewed his behavior as erratic (one would think acting erratically is not atypical for someone in medical distress) and called Nishawbe-Aski police.</p>
<p>The two officers who arrived pepper sprayed Wesley, tackled him onto the floor, beat him with a baton, and handcuffed his hands behind him. With police forcing him face down on the floor and with their boots on his head, neck, and back, Wesley stopped breathing. The inquest determined this to be an accident but we might reasonable ask if he would have died in the absence of this police assault.</p>
<p>None of the medical staff at the nursing station, including the doctor and nurses, did anything to help Wesley, perhaps fearful of police response if they tried. They only checked on him after he stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest, in a manner not unique in cases of police killing civilians, decided to blame the victim in their ruling. They found the cause of Wesley’s death to be “struggle and restraint (chest compression, prone positioning, handcuffing) as well as agitation and trauma (pain)&#8230;.with acute alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.” Restraint, agitation, and trauma are all directly attributable to actions taken by the police officers. These were not accidents.</p>
<p>The jury made 53 recommendations. Some of them highlight systemic racism within government services in Indigenous communities (without actually naming racism). They include:</p>
<p>Cultural training courses for nurses before being placed in an Indigenous community.</p>
<p>Hiring medical staff and police officers who speak the language of the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Developing a protocol for police interventions in medical facilities within Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Designating Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services as a police force under the Police Services Act in Ontario and thus providing for some civilian oversight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By all accounts Romeo Wesley was a beloved member of the community and is missed by many. The community was hoping for much more from this inquiry.</p>

Police took her into custody, but they noticed she had no vital signs and she was pronounced dead. An inquest found she died of accidental cocaine poisoning.; Chevranna Abdi was was seen holding a knife and behaving strangley in the stairwell of her apartment. One tenant managed to take a knife out of Abdi's hands before police arrived. Police took her into custody, but they noticed she had no vital signs and she was pronounced dead. An inquest found she died after choking on her vomit, which was brought on by an accidental cocaine poisoning.       *<p>There used to be an old saying, “Help the police, beat yourself up.” Now Michael Edelson, the lawyer for killer Ottawa cop Daniel Montsion, wants a court and the public to believe that the vicious beating his client inflicted on 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi had nothing to do with killing him. Instead, he suggests Abdi died of a heart attack. And he apparently wants people to believe that, even if he did have a heart attack, a severe beating with baton by police did not play a part in it. So, according to copagandist Edelson, Abdi is responsible for his own death: not the brutal assault he was subjected to. Maybe he beat himself to death.</p>
<p>Edelson made these absurd and offensive claims in an attempt to move up the court date for officer Montsion. According to audio court transcripts from the October 20 hearing, Edelson suggested: “This is not a beating that caused the death of Mr. Abdi. Mr. Abdi died of a heart attack. That’s what killed him.” Montsion has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in the killing of Abdi in July 2016.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s request to move the trial date was denied. The 12-week trial remains scheduled to start in February 2019, which is almost three years after Abdi’s killing.</p>
       *<p>Observant commentators have suggested that police actually operate like a gang, closing ranks unquestioningly to support their own no matter how egregious the member’s actions may have been. While there is some truth in this, police are not quite like gangs in that they lack the honor of gangs who at least have some limits, some acts they will not tolerate among members. If anyone needs a case in point they need only look at the dubious activities of the Ottawa Police Association and Ottawa police officers in response to the killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a Somalian-Canadian man suffering mental distress who was beaten to death by Constable Daniel Montsion in July of 2016. Montsion had previously expressed a problem with a suspect who was Somalian.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 29, 2017, the first day of preliminary court procedures leading to Montsion’s trial for manslaughter, several Ottawa police officers wore blue and black rubber wristbands stating “United We Stand #1998.” The number printed on the band is actually Montsion’s badge number. The rubber band bracelets are being sold for $2 apiece with the money going to the Ottawa Police Association.</p>
<p>This open show of support for a killer cop whose brutal beating of the defenseless man was partly caught on video is a tasteless and provocative move in a context that is already heated and where community members have mobilized against racist policing. It is an arrogant move that is clearly an attempt to put pressure on the court even as police say they do not comment on cases before the courts.</p>
<p>Incredibly the cops are using the excuse that it is a measure to address the trauma officers face on the job. This is part of a growing campaign to pose police crimes as primarily being about traumas for officers who then need more public money and resources for support. Some paid “criminologists” are being mustered to lend a veneer of credibility to the trauma money appeals led by police associations. Those same bought “criminologists” show little to no regard for the victims of police violence.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice for Abdirahman Abdi campaign, William Felepchuk, calls the bracelets an “outrage.” He notes that the nature of the crime Monsion is accused of is severe and suggest the move is an interference in the criminal justice process. Felepchuk further notes that police would not be so welcoming of civilians wearing such arm bands in cases of someone accused of killing a police officer.</p>
<p>Police always have pressures, both overt like the arm bands and covert like implied non-cooperation with prosecution, to apply on broader criminal justice processes. One should not expect anything resembling justice from the state in its dealings with killer cops.</p>
       *<p>The killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year old Somali Canadian man, by Ottawa Police Constable Daniel Montsion on July 24, 2016, was a particularly vicious and brutal affair which sparked community outrage and a community movement for “Justice for Abdirahman.” Montsion repeatedly delivered heavy baton blows to the defenseless man. On Monday March 6, 2017 Ontario’s police oversight agency, the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) brought three charges against Constable Montsion: manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon. Laying of charges against police officers who kill civilians is a too rare outcome in Canada.</p>
<p>The lethal beating of Abdi, a man struggling with mental health issues, while neighbors called out for the officers to stop was partially caught on video. Neighbors looked out for Abdi who was well known in the community and informed officers of his mental health issues and likely fear and lack of understanding of police commands. They implored officers to back off the frightened man but the assault with baton persisted. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the following day but family members say hospital officials told them the man was dead forty-five minutes before he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is a member of the Ottawa police direct action response team (DART) which targets gang but was assisting on patrol when he killed Abdi. Montsion has been on desk duty throughout the investigation and is now scheduled to appear at the Ontario court of justice in Ottawa on March 29. A second officer, Constable Dave Weir was involved in the assault on Abdi but the SIU concluded he was only a witness officer.</p>
<p>As reported previously by killercopscanada Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having a history of violence against Somali-Canadians. By his own admission he had “panicked” when faced with a suspect of Somali background in a case that might also have included the planting of evidence by police.</p>
<p>The police assault on Abdi began with a 911 call from a Bridgehead coffee shop in Abdi’s neighborhood in Ottawa. What happened there is still unclear but owner Tracey Clark says Abdi had made some customers feel uncomfortable or harassed. In her words:</p>
<p>“He would stand and stare at customers, or get a little bit too close, and we were beginning to hear from customers that it was making them feel uncomfortable. And so we had started to have those conversations where, ‘Are you aware of this behaviour, could we ask you not to do that?’ So there were some interventions like that that had taken place.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>After leaving the coffee shop Abdi apparently attempted to return to his apartment three blocks away. On the way he was intercepted by police. One witness, Ross McGhie reports that Abdi appeared fearful of receiving baton blows from the officer who clearly held a baton, and as a result picked up a piece of foam from the street (Nease and Pritchard 2017). He held it over his head in a defensive, not offensive, posture.</p>
<p>At some point, at the corner of Wellington and Hilda streets near Abdi’s apartment, the first officer tried to grab Abdi who dropped the foam and tried to run to his apartment building on Hilda Street. The officer prevented this by striking Abdi a few times on his legs, arms and upper body according to the witness Ross McGhie (Rease and Pritchard 2017). The officer also shouted at the stricken man.</p>
<p>At that point a second officer, said to be Constable Montsion, arrived on scene in a cruiser. He apparently moved very quickly and aggressively against the victim. In the words of McGhie: “The officer emerged from that car very rapidly &#8230; pulled up right in front of the building &#8230; immediately jumped into the altercation and administered a number of very heavy blows to the head and face and neck of Mr. Abdi” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family lawyer Lawrence Greenspon noted that family members had to endure much during the lengthy SIU investigation. In his words:</p>
<p>“It’s been extremely difficult. You not only have the incredible grief that we really can’t understand unless we go through it ourselves, and I don’t wish that on anybody. You have this grief of losing a son, brother, and it’s magnified … the public light has been shining on this death, this tragedy, for eight months now.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 20017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenspon said that the family would likely be pursuing a civil lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>The SIU report is with Ontario&#8217;s attorney general, at present Ottawa Centre Member of  Provincial Parliament Yasir Naqvi but it is not clear if Naqvi will make the report public or not. This has been a case of great public interest and concern. More than is often the case in situations involving police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi was the focus of important public mobilizations and campaigns, including mobilizations of “Black Lives Matter.” Large demonstrations calling for “Justice for Abdirahman” were held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. #justiceforabdirahman gained much attention on social media.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, “panicked” during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.</p>
<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion’s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion’s story conflicted both with Adoyta’s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya’s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man’s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he “sort of panicked” and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion’s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the “manner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta’s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta’s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept” (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: “This is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta” (quoted in Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.</p>
<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled “gun” around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.</p>
<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted “evidence.” So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion’s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.</p>

       *<p>The police violence inflicted on Black lives, the killing of Black people, in the Canadian context has received much less public attention, scrutiny, and response than in the United States. The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

In an initial report, independent investigators said Saidi died after an ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù with officers that ended when one of the officers shot Saidi. Police said the fatal shooting was the result of an ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with officers. An independent investigation is underway.; Babak Saidi, 43, arrived at a police detachment for his weekly check-in, the result of a 2014 conviction for assault. Saidi was shot dead less than two minutes after he entered the OPP station. According to the SIU report, as two officers tried to arrest Saidi on new charges, he tried to exit the building. The officers pursued him and tried to grab Saidi from behind. They fired a taser that failed to work and Saidi managed to grab hold of the weapon, says the report. In that moment, one officer fired his gun and Saidi was shot three times. Saidi had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was taking medication for it. The SIU cleared the officers of any wrongdoing. But a coroner's inquest was set to launch but has been delayed until further notice. ;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>Babak Saidi was shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) outside their Morrisburg detachment only minutes after his father dropped him off for a scheduled probation check-in on December 23, 2017. While little has been reported publicly about the details of the killing, as it rarely is in cases of police killings in Canada, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has designates a lone subject officer in their investigation. This means they believe that a sole officer fired the shot(s) that struck and killed Babak Saidi that day. As is unfortunately the standard practice in Canada the officer responsible for the killing has not been identified publicly. Saidi’s killing is being investigated by the provincial police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, which has assigned four investigators and three forensic specialists to the case.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Saidi, whose was born in Iran but came to Canada as a refugee with his family, had been diagnosed with late onset schizophrenia and social paranoia according to his family. They are looking for answers and for mechanisms to address the ongoing use of violence by police toward people experiencing mental health issues.</p>
<p>In the words of Babak Saidi’s sister, Elly Saidi:  “This is yet another shocking example of a lethal police response to an unarmed person with mental health disabilities. I want everyone to learn from this tragic experience” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>Babak Saidi had gone to the same OPP station more than 30 times — every week for nine months — in 2017. Elly Saidi says that the family remains very much in the dark about why his routine check-in at the police station so quickly turned deadly. In her words “It would be good to get an explanation for what happened. I don’t know what instigated it: Why this time was so different than every other time?” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>Saidi’s father, Mehrab Saidi (83), has reported hearing “multiple gunshots” while in his car, moments after dropping off his son at the detachment. He has also said that he was instructed by police to wait at a nearby coffee shop for more information and was only notified of his sons death hours later.</p>
<p>Elly Saidi is chief executive of United World Voices, a registered charity in Ottawa that works with homeless youth and vulnerable women. She says her brother was only diagnosed with schizophrenia early in 2017 as the family had not been able to get a diagnosis for him. In her words: “We told lawyers for many years he needs help. Like a lot of people in his position, they fall through the cracks. He should have been assessed and treated much earlier. We knew there was something wrong with him, but it was hard to get anyone to listen. That’s the frustrating part” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>In the view of Elly Saidi her brother should not have died in the encounter:</p>
<p>“What is beyond doubt is that OPP members involved in this tragedy were unable to peacefully de-escalate this situation. The OPP resorted to a lethal response to an unarmed individual with mental disabilities. I know that things can escalate from zero to 100 in a few seconds with mentally ill people. The police need to know how to deal with that, how to de-escalate and contain the situation.” (quoted in Duffy 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Babak Saidi had publicly reported feeling harassed by local police in Brockville, Ontario, where he lived. During a 2003 court hearing, Saidi, then 29, told a judge that police in Brockville “have been on my ass for 10 years” (quoted in Duffy 2018). He continued, telling Ontario Court Justice Charles Anderson : “They don’t like me and I don’t like them” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>In 2017 Ontario’s Office of the Independent Police Review Director compiled records showing that 142 people were fatally shot during interactions with police between January 1990 and December 2016 (Duffy 2018). Calls for de-escalation training have been made repeatedly in studies and reviews on police violence and mental health with no meaningful improvements. At the end of the day police remain the unaccountable monopoly on violence acting with impunity in communities.</p>

       <p>Many disturbing questions remain after Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) shot and killed 43-year-old Babak Saidi inside the detachment in Morrisburg, Ontario on Saturday, December 23, 2017. Saidi, who experienced schizophrenia, was under conditions to check in weekly at the detachment following a 2014 conviction for assault and battery. He had been making those weekly check-ins regularly before something went deeply wrong during the December 23 check-in. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating. They have assigned seven investigators to the scene. Morrisburg is 80 milometers south of the nation’s capital, Ottawa.</p>
<p>Babak Saidi headed to the Saturday morning check-in with a tin full of freshly baked muffins, a Christmas gift for his father and a family friend who were providing his ride to the detachment. For family, the muffins were a sign that Babak Saidi was in a good mood. Hi sister, Elly Saidi remembers him fondly: “My brother, he was the kindest, sweetest, most loving person. He had a mental disability, and we need to know how to deal with a person with mental disability” (quoted in Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>Few details have been released publicly regarding what happened at the detachment, but his sister has provided her father’s view of events as he experienced and witnessed them. Elly Saidi reports that, according to her father, the three were told to wait about 15 minutes when they arrived at the police station. They decided to go do some grocery shopping, and when they returned, Babak Saidi left the car to go inside. In very short order the father would see his son the ground, with two officers on top of him. Babak Saidi was taken into the detachment by officers and, according to the father, two shots were heard within two minutes. The SIU has confirmed that Babak Saidi was the person struck by the officer fired shots and that he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Oddly,  a police officer then told Saidi’s father and his friend to go to a nearby Tim Hortons and wait until someone arrived to explain what happened. After a few hours, police finally arrived to deliver an awful message in an apparently cold manner. According to Elly Saidi: “They waited for a few hours, and then the police came. My dad asked the police, ‘Where is my son?’ And the police officer told my dad that, sorry, your son is gone” (quoted in Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>This was all the family was told about what happened, a full ten hours after the shooting. The family says this delay and the ongoing lack of information are “unacceptable.” They are, sadly, too common in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>In Elly Said’s words: “I have to be strong for my parents. It’s very hard to see my mom and my dad crying and being heartbroken. My mom was sitting in a corner of the room, hugging my brother’s picture. And all she’s saying is, ‘I don’t know what happened. I don’t know where his body is’” (quoted in Pritchard 2017). A worker with homeless youth in Ottawa, she says she needs to speak out because of the numerous cases of police violence, including lethal violence, inflicted on people with mental health issues in Canadian contexts. Reflecting on police in Canada, she says:</p>
<p>“They have absolutely no tools and no awareness to deal with people with mental disability. Too many people with mental disabilities have died at the hands of the police. They need to have education and awareness [of] how to deal with people with mental disability. And not [assume] they&#8217;re all bad and a menace to society.” (quoted in Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>The SIU has reported that they will be interviewing the subject officer as well as 10 officers who were witnesses. One can only imagine how police witnesses to police killings will report events. There have been issues with timelines for interviewing police officers following police involved killings, with no assurances that officers will not compare and fix their stories.</p>

On August 2, 2017, Dr. James Edwards, the regional supervising coroner for Central Region (Toronto Easy office) gave notice of the inquest.</p>
<p>An SIU (Special Investigations Unit) investigation of the killing concluded that Toronto police had been instructed to set up surveillance at the Tryst nightclub on reports that Skene-Peters would be present. The Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) (ironically) was also on hand to provide “additional officer support” and were parked in a nearby alley. Skene-Peters was in his car around 3 AM when a civilian vehicle boxed him in and police decided to make a charge on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Notably, a witness who spoke with CBC Toronto at the time reported that between 20 to 30 shots were fired and he did not hear police make any demands toward Skene-Peters before opening fire on him (CBC News 2017). Upon hearing the shots the witness fled in fear. Could a less dramatic approach by police avoided taking of a life in this case? Particularly given that Skene-Peters was in a vehicle and boxed in and police had positioning.</p>
<p>The SIU report noted that both of the officers who shot Skene-Peters declined to participate in the SIU investigation. There is currently no mechanism used to make killer cops comply with SIU investigations.</p>

News reports said Brooks was acting erratically while walking down a street, and neighbours reported hearing screaming followed by gunshots. An RCMP officer was charged with aggrivated assault and assault with a weapon in the death. Prosecutors dropped the case two years later.;    Shot by RCMP after called in as suicidal.; Coroner's Service yet to announce investigation; TBD; TBD; TBD;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>On Saturday, July 18, 2015, Hudson Daryl Willis Brooks (20) was killed by RCMP right in front of the District Office in South Surrey, BC. The young man was reported to be in some distress before being shot by RCMP after apparently minimal engagement. No independent reports or witness statements have been released. Police provided few details even days after the killing. This killing by RCMP once again raises serious concerns about deadly police interactions with people who may be experiencing mental health issues and the quickness of police to deploy lethal force upon encountering people in distress. Initially RCMP reported that an officer had also been shot, leaving the impression that the man they killed may have shot the officer. It was revealed days later (Monday, July 21) that the injured officer had been shot by another RCMP member.</p>
       ***<p>On Thursday, July 16, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre (48). McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntrye, who worked as a dishwasher at another local restaurant in Dawson Creek, has been claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre’s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency’s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.</p>
<p>This killing by RCMP has occurred in a context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of “anti-terrorism.”</p>
       ***<p>On Friday June 24, 2015, Benjamin “Monty” Robinson (RCMP) was sentenced to two years in prison plus probation and 240 hours of community service for perjury. Eight years earlier, on October 14, 2007, then-corporal Robinson along with three other RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bently, and Kwesi Millington, killed Polish traveler Robert Dziekański at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The unarmed Dziekański had been tasered five times by the officers who also deployed batons and pinned the man to the ground and handcuffed him as he was dying. Robinson, the senior officer in charge during the Dziekański killing, had been convicted of lying to an inquiry examining the events of the killing. A BC Supreme Court judge found Robinson guilty of perjury in June of 2015, ruling that he colluded with the four fellow officers to make up testimony that they presented at the inquiry into Dziekanski’s death.</p>
<p>Immediately following their killing of Dziekański, RCMP made a series of false public statements. They told a story apparently designed to denigrate Dziekański in the public eye and initially claimed he threw things and screamed and yelled after police arrived. It was also suggested that Dziekański was intoxicated. Police also claimed only three officers attended the scene. All of this was contradicted when a bystander video taken by traveler Paul Pritchard came forward. The video showed, contrary to police, that the taser was not used as a last resort but was deployed almost immediately. Police took Pritchard’s video and refused to return it until he brought forward a lawsuit for its return.</p>
<p>Notably, Monty Robinson was also convicted of obstruction of justice in a separate trial after the vehicle he was driving hit and killed a young motorcyclist, Orion Hutchinson (21), in October 2008. In that case Robinson apparently used knowledge gained as a police officer in order to cover up the fact that he had been driving after consuming alcohol. After hitting and killing Robinson left the scene, went home and drank two shots of vodka which he had learned could cover up the fact he had been drinking earlier. Incredibly, Robinson received no jail time in that case, being sentenced to one month of house arrest. Hutchinson’s mother claimed the sentence seemed only like Robinson was being grounded.</p>
       *<p>When it comes to police killings of civilians, the state protects the state. This is not surprising given that police are the force of brute violence (the state’s monopoly on violence) which always accompanies and underpins the state’s legislative (ideological) face. Law and force go hand in hand.</p>
<p>On July 18, 2015, RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran shot 20-year-old Hudson Brooks nine times outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey, killing him. The Constable fired a dozen times at the youth, who was shirtless and shoeless and in some mental health distress. On September 18, 2019, more than four years later, the British Columbia prosecution service announced that charges of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon had been stayed against Constable Cucheran.</p>
<p>That the killer cop did not even face charges of murder or manslaughter for shooting an unarmed youth nine times and that it took more than four years to reach this decision shows the special manner with which police who kill are treated by the state in Canada.</p>
<p>Even more, in announcing their the prosecution service chose to emphasize that “<a href=""https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/charges-stayed-against-rcmp-officer-who-killed-man-in-surrey-b-c"">the law is clear that even the mistaken belief in the need to use lethal force is a complete defence</a>.” Killer cops always have this excuse, no matter how unjustified, ludicrous, or unsubstantiated, at their ready disposal. It is all they ever need to kill when they want, under whatever conditions they themselves alone decide. Police define the circumstances and they define reasonableness. Even if they are mistaken or lying. Few prosecutors, who depend on police for their cases (and who also uphold the state as do police), will ever challenge them. It is literally a license to kill.</p>
<p>This case earlier showed as well the way in which police lie after they kill someone to suggest that the victim posed a greater threat than they did. To blame the victim. Initial RCMP statements suggested that there had been an exchange of gunfire and an officer was also shot. This gave a public impression that Brooks had been armed and there had been some sort of gunfight between the victim and officers. It was later revealed that Constable Cucheran, in a lethal panic, had shot herself among the 12 shots she fired.</p>
       *<p>RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran has been charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in the killing of Hudson Brooks on July 18, 2015 in Surrey, British Columbia, a rare case of a killer cop being charged in Canada. On January 9, 2018, Constable Cucheran pleaded not guilty to both charges. The officer’s lawyer Andrea Kastanis entered the not guilty pleas on Cucheran’s behalf as Cucheran did not attend provincial court in Surrey, Interestingly, Kastanis also informed the court that Cucheran has elected to be tried by judge and jury rather than judge alone. The next step court dates will involve a preliminary inquiry now scheduled  take place over eight days in November and December of 2018.</p>
<p>No members of the Brooks family attended court on January 9, saying they will wait for the trial to start. The family has organized a number of events and started a campaign calling for Justice for Hudson since their loved one was shot and killed outside an RCMP detachment in South Surrey in 2015. They had a very long wait with little information about the killing of Hudson Brooks. Cucheran was only charged at the end of 2017, nearly two and a half years after Brooks died.</p>
<p>The RCMP has placed Cucheran on administrative duties. The force had initially suggested publicly that Brooks had a weapon as an officer was shot during the killing. It turns out that only police service weapons were present at the scene and that would was inflicted by the RCMP themselves.</p>
       *<p>RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran has been charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of assault with a weapon in the 2015 killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia. Brooks was shot by RCMP and killed outside the District 5 RCMP detachment on 152 Street in south Surrey at around 2:30 AM on July 18, 2015.</p>
<p>The BC Prosecution Service approved the charges on Tuesday, December 19, 2017, following a 15-month investigation by the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia, the unit that investigates police harm to civilians in the province.  Incredibly, the IIO wrapped up its investigation and sent its report to the BC Prosecution Service to consider charges in October of 2016. Yes, 14 months ago. So more questions are raised in a case that already has too many about why the Crown prosecutors took so long to lay charges. Is it because the killer was a police officer, an RCMP constable? This question must be asked given the tendency by Crown not to bring charges against killer cops even where charges are recommended.</p>
<p>Brooks was unarmed, dressed in shorts and flip flops when officers approached him outside the detachment. He was said to be screaming, possibly asking for help, according to some witnesses, when he was shot and killed. An officer was also shot and in first reports it was suggested that the officer had somehow been injured by Brooks, the implication being a shootout. It turns out this was a police distortion, perhaps designed to cast suspicion on the victim and to legitimize the officers’ actions publicly. It was eventually revealed that the officer had been shot by a weapon fired by police (no weapons other than police weapons were on the scene).</p>
<p>This has been a grueling process for the Brooks family who have worked hard to gain information about the killing of their loved one and to see those officers responsible held to some account. Family and friends of Hudson Brooks started a movement called Justice For Hudson to bring public attention to and to call for information about the police killing. They held several marches through south Surrey which were attended by hundreds of people and went right to the RCMP detachment. The Brooks family has repeatedly stated their frustration publicly with the length of time for the investigation and the lack of responsiveness by authorities.</p>
<p>Killer cop Cucheran is scheduled for a first appearance in Surrey provincial court on January 9, 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>A matter of seconds. That was all the time that transpired before Surrey RCMP officers decided to shoot and kill Hudson Brooks after encountering the youth,  as revealed in newly released audio of the killing.</p>
<p>Most of the significant questions about the RCMP killing of Hudson Brooks outside an RCMP community policing detachment in south Surrey, British Columbia remain unanswered almost two years after the 20-year old was shot by police on July 18, 2015. His family has persistently sought answers, both of police and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province.</p>
<p>In March 2017 police audio of the killing of Hudson Brooks was posted on YouTube. Notably, the clip was not released to family by police who have been uncommunicative regarding the killing. The audio was apparently posted by a user who regularly uploads recordings of police-involved incidents from radio traffic and scanners. The 2 minutes and 41 seconds of audio reveal the chaos of police actions and confirm the quick move by officers to deploy lethal force with virtually no interaction with, or attempt to communicate with the young man who would become their victim.</p>
<p>After hearing the audio, Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks’ mother responded:  “It was devastating. It was so heartbreaking. There was no ‘stop, put up your hands,’ nothing. Within seconds of them calling upon him, he was shot. He didn’t stand a chance. How this went so wrong so quickly is unfathomable” (quoted in Chan 2017).</p>
<p>The audio confirmed what the family and some commentators have managed to piece together about the killing, from witnesses and available limited reports. Up front a female voice is heard describing Hudson Brooks. At the 52 second point, a male voice is heard saying: “I got something right here coming directly at me.” In a matter of mere seconds later: “I need help now. I need help now.” Then the call of “shots fired.”</p>
<p>The tape does confirm what many have suspected for some time, that the RCMP officer who was shot during the encounter actually shot herself. In the audio a female voice can be heard saying, “I shot myself.” This is followed by a male voice calling for emergency services: “Suspect is critical. We need a code. We need it now.” This is noteworthy because police initially used the shooting of an officer to suggest to the public that Hudson Brooks was armed and inflicted the wound, thus justifying, in their view, the deployment of lethal force.</p>
<p>The IIO has requested that the recording be taken down. Jennifer Brooks, however, says that while she would not listen too it again she supports it being publicly available so long as it does not impact the ongoing IIO investigation. In her  words: “Otherwise, the public needs to hear what happened” (quoted in Chan 2017). And answers are needed now. Why did police shoot? And why did they jump to shoot so quickly? Why did officers panic to such an extent that one would shoot herself and what does this say about the safety of any public into which such panicky officers are deployed? Too much time has passed with minimal to no information from police or the IIO.</p>

       *<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer’s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consideration of Charges?</p>
<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.” (quoted in Johnstone 2016)</p>
<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Justice for Hudson”</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: “I wouldn’t say I’m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for “Justice For Hudson” to raise awareness about Hudson’s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.</p>
<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: “We’re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism</p>

       *<p>It says plenty about the protections afforded police who kill civilians in Canada that months after a killing even minimal details about the event are not released to public or media. Officers involved are shielded from public scrutiny. Media are not allowed to report the issue in a manner consistent with an open and democratic system. Loved ones are left to ask painful questions. And live with excruciating silence from the agencies involved and responsible for providing answers. This serves to protect the system and allows police agencies time to reconstruct events, and their stories, to suit their own interests.</p>
<p>Seven months after Hudson Brooks, 20, was shot down in the street outside of an RCMP detachment in South Surrey, BC, the young man’s family has received no answers and few insights into how or why their loved one came to be a victim of police violence. This despite repeated requests made to the RCMP and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the province’s police oversight body for information. This despite public appeals for disclosure from the RCMP, IIO, and local politicians, including two marches involving hundreds of supporters.</p>
<p>What is known for sure is that Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and killed by an RCMP officer or officers outside the force’s South Surrey detachment. The IIO, in one of its few informational statements on the killing, has also confirmed that only a police service weapon was recovered at the scene. No other weapons were present. This is crucial because RCMP, as is often the case in police killings of civilians, initially suggested in media reports that there had been an exchange of shots between Brooks and the RCMP resulting in a gunshot wound to one officer. It now appears that the officer’s injury was either self-inflicted or a result of friendly fire. Brooks was not even wearing a t-shirt at the time he was shot and killed. He had no weapon or place to hide it.</p>
<p>Later police tried to claim that Brooks was suicidal. As in other recent cases in BC the RCMP sought to disparage and blame the victim (as if being suicidal could legitimize police killing someone—only in that authoritarian culture of impunity). Brooks family and friends have been clear and consistent that the young man was happy, optimistic, with a bright future.</p>
<p>Incredibly, neither Surrey’s Mayor Linda Hepner nor local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) for Surrey-White Rock Gordon Hogg have contacted the Brooks family whether to provide information or even to offer condolences. In the words of Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks’ mother: “Our son was shot down in the streets of Surrey—they haven’t reached out to me. Where is the compassion? A young man loses his life and we’re not contacted” (quoted in Holmes 2016). A stunning lack of compassion, and basic human decency, which would certainly not be the case in the event of a police officer being killed by a civilian.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ mother has lived with indescribable pain since her son was killed by RCMP officers early in the morning on July 18, 2015. Following the February 2016 march commemorating her son, Jennifer Brooks asked: “Every moment of everyday, I wonder, I get up, first thing I think of is what happened to Hudson? How did this escalate to the point that lethal force was used on my son, my unarmed son?” (quoted in Beja 2016).<br />
There is much for the RCMP to answer for. Jennifer Brooks needs to know. The RCMP need to answer: “I don’t know why my unarmed son was shot multiple times. Why was lethal force used on Hudson? Why was he shot five to seven times? The silence is killing me. I have no answers. It’s devastating” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Outrageously, the IIO points to an increase in officer-involved shootings, and the strain on resources they cause, as leading to a backlog of investigations that has left many families of victims of police violence seeking answers. According to Marten Youssef, spokesperson for the IIO: “Our timeliness has suffered, and that is partly due to a spike in officer-involved shootings and officer-involved fatalities” (quoted in Beja 2016). According to provincial records, between September 2014 and December 2015, there were 20 officer-involved fatalities, 12 were firearm-related, in British Columbia. That compares to one recorded fatal shooting by police in 2013 and three fatal shootings by police in 2012. The rise in killings of civilians by police in BC has led the IIO to hire more investigators to deal with the back-log. At public expense. Yet the activities of the IIO since their inception suggest that they remain largely toothless in holding killer cop accountable or in reigning in murderous forces in the province. In effect they offer no deterrence for killer cops and minimal real oversight.</p>
<p>Jennifer Brooks suggests that the increase in police-involved shootings over the previous year points to a pressing need for better training. In her view: “When there is someone in distress, the first thing to do is not shoot, not use lethal force” (quoted in Beja 2016). In the words of Hudson Brooks’ brother Beaudry: “Too many don’t have proper training and aren’t ready for the position they are in. It leads to things like this. It shouldn’t have happened” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Others would suggest that disarming the police in British Columbia might be a necessary step. Others call for ending the RCMP contracts in sub/urban centers like Surrey.</p>
<p>The silence and disengagement from public requests for answers is telling in the context of RCMP targeting of Surrey for increased policing and stated efforts toward community mobilization. Indeed the RCMP has long viewed Surrey as a site of force expansion and budgetary increase. They are banking on Surrey, and fear campaigns and moral panics targeting the city, in a context in which crime rates on the whole are declining consistently over years (with associated threats to police budgets). RCMP have established a public relations outreach officer in Surrey staffed by an officer who is also part of the RCMP campaign to gain a foothold in local communities by securing a faculty position in the local university, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, that enrolls the greatest proportion of Surrey post-secondary students. This has been central in efforts to recruit younger local residents while gaining access to informants, friends and family, in the neighborhoods of Surrey.</p>
<p>Yet when families ask for answers about the RCMP killing their children, nothing.</p>

       *<p>Six weeks after the RCMP killing of Surrey youth Hudson Brooks (who turned 20 shortly before he was shot by police) serious, and troubling, questions remain about police actions and the situation surrounding the killing. Brooks was shot by an RCMP officer outside of a community policing office in South Surrey, BC in circumstances that have not yet been properly explained.</p>
<p>Police initially claimed that Brooks was suicidal, but have offered nothing to suggest this was actually the case, and made statements implying that an officer had been injured by Brooks in some sort of confrontation. This latter insinuation has been discredited by forensic evidence at the scene which found only police issue equipment.</p>
<p>The only information provided by police is sketchy and unverified. Police suggest that a “call for service” involving a “suicidal” man apparently screaming and in some distress in the area of the 1800-block of 152nd Street in Surrey. Officers from the community office responded, located Hudson Brooks, and in some sort of struggle shots were fired. Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and died.</p>
<p>His mother wants answers and is working to get them: “This is my campaign for justice for Hudson. I will never stop nor rest until I receive justice, and justice means I want these officers charged. They cannot just shoot a young man and just walk away, badge or no badge” (quoted in Saltman 2015).</p>
<p>Family and friends dispute the police depiction of Brooks and his emotional state. The day that Brooks was killed he was going to the beach to be with friends, something he regularly did on weekends and was reported to be in good spirits. His mother calls police claims that Brooks was suicidal “completely untrue” and “a false accusation” (Saltman 2015). She says instead: “My son loved life. He lived life to the fullest, he was happy” (quoted in Saltman 2015). She wants to know what really happened and why. She wants to know why lethal force was deployed apparently so quickly and in the absence of non-lethal options. And, above all, she wants accountability.</p>
<p>Family, friends, and supporters are organizing a community march for September 26, 2015 to honor Hudson and others killed through interaction with police. The march will begin at 152nd Street and 16th Avenue in Surrey and continue along 152nd Street to around 24th Avenue. Marchers intend to gather at the memorial in front of the South Surrey RCMP office. Sweatshirts, stickers, and bracelets with the slogan “#JusticeForHudson” are also being produced and distributed by supporters.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of B.C. is still investigating the shooting. The RCMP report that the “subject officer” is currently on administrative duties.</p>

McIntosh was out for a bike ride with his father when struck by the officer who was making a right-hand turn in the intersection.

The officer who killed the boy is a member of the Penticton RCMP detachment and has been placed on administrative leave. The Independent Investigation Office of BC (IIO) has been called in to investigate.</p>

An independent investigation confirmed that McIntyre, associated with the hacker group Anonymous, was not the subject of the original complaint, but police said he had a closed switchblade in his palm and refused commands to drop it. Police pepper-sprayed him, but it was ineffective, and when McIntyre came toward police with the knife, one of the officers shot him. The investigation revealed the whole encounter lasted no more than 21 seconds. The investigation cleared the officers.;    Shot by RCMP at BC Hydro info session for Site C dam.; Coroner's Service yet to announce investigation; TBD; TBD; TBD;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>On Thursday, July 16, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre (48). McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntrye, who worked as a dishwasher at another local restaurant in Dawson Creek, has been claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre’s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency’s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.</p>
<p>This killing by RCMP has occurred in a context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of “anti-terrorism.”</p>
       ***<p>On Saturday, July 18, 2015, Hudson Daryl Willis Brooks (20) was killed by RCMP right in front of the District Office in South Surrey, BC. The young man was reported to be in some distress before being shot by RCMP after apparently minimal engagement. No independent reports or witness statements have been released. Police provided few details even days after the killing. This killing by RCMP once again raises serious concerns about deadly police interactions with people who may be experiencing mental health issues and the quickness of police to deploy lethal force upon encountering people in distress. Initially RCMP reported that an officer had also been shot, leaving the impression that the man they killed may have shot the officer. It was revealed days later (Monday, July 21) that the injured officer had been shot by another RCMP member.</p>
       ***<p>On Friday June 24, 2015, Benjamin “Monty” Robinson (RCMP) was sentenced to two years in prison plus probation and 240 hours of community service for perjury. Eight years earlier, on October 14, 2007, then-corporal Robinson along with three other RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bently, and Kwesi Millington, killed Polish traveler Robert Dziekański at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The unarmed Dziekański had been tasered five times by the officers who also deployed batons and pinned the man to the ground and handcuffed him as he was dying. Robinson, the senior officer in charge during the Dziekański killing, had been convicted of lying to an inquiry examining the events of the killing. A BC Supreme Court judge found Robinson guilty of perjury in June of 2015, ruling that he colluded with the four fellow officers to make up testimony that they presented at the inquiry into Dziekanski’s death.</p>
<p>Immediately following their killing of Dziekański, RCMP made a series of false public statements. They told a story apparently designed to denigrate Dziekański in the public eye and initially claimed he threw things and screamed and yelled after police arrived. It was also suggested that Dziekański was intoxicated. Police also claimed only three officers attended the scene. All of this was contradicted when a bystander video taken by traveler Paul Pritchard came forward. The video showed, contrary to police, that the taser was not used as a last resort but was deployed almost immediately. Police took Pritchard’s video and refused to return it until he brought forward a lawsuit for its return.</p>
<p>Notably, Monty Robinson was also convicted of obstruction of justice in a separate trial after the vehicle he was driving hit and killed a young motorcyclist, Orion Hutchinson (21), in October 2008. In that case Robinson apparently used knowledge gained as a police officer in order to cover up the fact that he had been driving after consuming alcohol. After hitting and killing Robinson left the scene, went home and drank two shots of vodka which he had learned could cover up the fact he had been drinking earlier. Incredibly, Robinson received no jail time in that case, being sentenced to one month of house arrest. Hutchinson’s mother claimed the sentence seemed only like Robinson was being grounded.</p>
       *<p>There is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.</p>
<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:</p>
<p>“As of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.” (IIO 2016)</p>
<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: “They are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.” (quoted in Kurjata 2016)</p>
<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.</p>
<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law—they are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.</p>
<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a “weapon” rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after</em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.</p>
<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:  “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that…it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Kurjata 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post</em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:</p>
<p>“Our message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it’s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.” (quoted in Humphreys 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.</p>

Two officers told an independent investigation that Loku advanced on them, and shot Loku twice in the chest when he refused an order to drop the hammer. Although an independent investigation didn't find reason to recommend criminal charges to the Crown, it publicly chastised an officer for allegedly trying to download the surveillance footage of the incident.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>Andrew Loku (45), a refugee from South Sudan who suffered PTSD from experiences of torture, was shot and killed by Toronto police officer Andrew Doyle on July 5, 2015. On Friday, June 30, 2017, jury members in a coroner’s inquest into the killing ruled that his death was a homicide. Unfortunately, the Special Investigations Unit, the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians had already decided, in March 2016, that Constable Doyle would not face criminal charges</p>
<p>The month long inquest headed by Dr. John Carlisle had gone beyond previous coroner’s inquests into police killings by actually addressing, at least in part, the role of racism in policing as influencing the actions of Constable Doyle and his partner Haim Queroub and contributing to their lethal use of force. During the inquest officer Doyle admitted to having almost no experiences interacting with Black men (Perkel 2017). Neighbors described Mr. Loku, a father of five, as a sweet man. Doyle and Queroub responded to him as something else. Lawyers argued that the officers’ fear of Black men contributed to their violent actions. It seems the inquest jury agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 39 Steps</p>
<p>The inquest jury made 39 recommendations which were read into the record by by coroner John Carlisle Among the recommendations are these:</p>
<p>Training police on implicit bias and anti-black racism.</p>
<p>Collecting race-based data, to be made public, and funding research to analyze the data.</p>
<p>Equipping police cars with less lethal means of force, including shields and helmets.</p>
<p>Allowing front-line officers to be equipped with Tasers.</p>
<p>Additional training for 911 operators to elicit more information during a call that can help aid in de-escalation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian Mental Health Association executive director Steve Lurie noted: “You have to pass a test on whether you know how to fire a gun, but you don’t have to pass a test on whether you know how to de-escalate” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a).</p>
<p>The inquest ruling said that police officers should be exposed “to the perspectives and lived experience of racialized communities, the Black community and individuals with mental health issues and/or addictions.” Among the recommendations provided by the jury was that police be required to measure the effectiveness of training related to “anti-black racism and persons in crisis” through means of written and oral examinations. Officers should also be tested for implicit racial bia, and re-attend the training if they fail any of these.</p>
<p>Loku family lawyer Jonathan Shime said to reporters afterward that Andrew Loku should not have had to die for recommendations like these to raised and implemented. In his words: “To be frank, Andrew’s not here, and this whole inquest was necessary because somebody died and children are now without their father and sisters are now without their brother&#8221; (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a). This is the underlying truth in this.</p>
<p>On the whole the recommendations are not remarkable and some have been raised too many time before. They do not address the structural role of police and policing within state capitalist political economies and do not address their ongoing systemic measures as upholders of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and exploitation. But, that, of course will not be addresses through any state venue such as an inquest. The community groups and mobilizations around police racism and violence have shown the real possibilities for change and the necessity for change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Institutional Racism and Police Violence</p>
<p>Observers of the inquest have commended the fact that finally an inquest has highlighted intersections between racialization, racism, mental health, and police violence. In Shime’s words: “The reality is a disproportionate number of black men are dying at the hands of police, and it’s time for that to stop. We need to reduce that to zero” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a). As Shime and others have noted, the inquest made very clear that racism contributed to the police killing of Andrew Loku and officers did not need to use lethal force against him. The recommendations address, if insufficiently, issues of explicit, conscious, as well as implicit, subconscious, racism.</p>
<p>The inquest had heard how six people in the apartment complex had interacted with Loku ahead of the arrival of police. Neighbors said that they said they had been able to calm Mr. Loku down and that, in fact, he was about to hand over the hammer he was holding when the police officers charged onto the floor and confronted him (Perkel 2017). Within around 20 seconds of their arrival Constable Doyle fired twice, hitting Mr. Loku on the left side of his chest.</p>
<p>Shime argued that the officers panicked, in part because Andrew Loku was Black. In his words: “I don’t think Andrew needed to die. There were a number of failings with respect to the training and the handling of this situation that precipitated his death” (quoted in Perkel 2017). The issues go well beyond training of course.</p>
<p>Kingsley Gilliam, with the Black Action Defence Committee, identified systemic racism. In his words, following the inquest: “They recognized that anti-black racism, racism and institutional racism are problems and that racism permeates society” (quoted in Perkel 2017). Gilliam, went further, calling Loku’s death “an execution” (quoted in Perkel 2017).</p>
<p>Lawyer Selwyn Pieters, also with the Black Action Defence Committee, called out the stereotyping of Black men as aggressive and violent. In his words: “When you stereotype black people, particularly men that way, it is more likely to lead to very unfortunate outcomes for black men” (quoted in Perkel 2017). For Constable Doyle it seems that the stereotypes were all that he drew on in the encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter: Community Mobilization is Key</p>
<p>Pieters further said that there will be community mobilization if the recommendations of this inquest are not implemented. Clearly community members will we watching to see what happens with the recommendations. Pieters told reporters that the BADC wants to see all 39 of the inquest recommendations implemented within one year, along with those of an ongoing police oversight review by Justice Michael Tulloch, or there will be an active response. In the words of BADC member Kingsley Gilliam: “We are going to hold their feet to the fire” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017b).</p>
<p>The significant role of Black Lives Matter and other community organizers has to be acknowledged and lauded, both in initiating the inquest and in seeing issues of racism addressed. They also have to be lauded for broadly reframing public perceptions of policing in general. As Pieters suggests:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s advocacy in the court and there&#8217;s street advocacy. You’ve seen Black Lives Matter were outside of police headquarters for two weeks to get this Loku inquest. I’m sure they’ll be watching this inquest with interest and they will respond appropriately if the recommendations aren’t implemented. They fought for this” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling is not a criminal one, as the Loku family&#8217;s lawyer Jonathan Shime explained outside of the inquest Friday. In a coroner&#8217;s inquest, the word is used to mean a death was the result of someone&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>A report published by the <em>Toronto Star</em> In August 2015, one month after Andrew Loku was shot and killed by Toronto police officer Andrew Doyle, found that, of the 51 fatal shootings involving the Toronto police between 1990 and 2015, at least 18 involved Black men (Gillis 2017). This represented 35 percent of fatal police shootings (Gillis 2017). In another 17 cases, or 33 percent, the racialized background of the victim of the police killing was deemed not identifiable with certainty (Gillis 2017). The population of Black people in Toronto over that time was approximately nine percent. Despite this fact there had been reluctance by some, including the coroner, as well as expected opposition from police, to address the issue of institutional racism among police head on and by name in the inquest into Andrew Loku’s killing by police.</p>
<p>Marianne Wright, the lawyer representing Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders, said parties to the inquest “should stick to the notions which are within the scope of the inquest. I’m struggling with the emotional content of the word racism” (quoted in Gillis 2017). Others struggled with the emotional content of racism itself and the racist actions of killer cops in Toronto.</p>
<p>Howard Morton, the lawyer for community group Across Boundaries, a mental health organization working for racialized communities and the organization that called McKenzie as a witness, argued that there was “nothing wrong with confronting a live issue like racism. To deprive me of the use of the word racism . . . it just confounds me and I’m flummoxed to the nth degree about why we’re all afraid of that term” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p>
<p>The discussion of institutional racism centered on the looming testimony of Dr. Kwame McKenzie, a psychiatrist and the director of health equity at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, who was set to address organizational practices and racism. His work argues that organizations need to acknowledge that racism exists in their institutions in order to effect change.</p>
<p>Coroner and inquest head Dr. John Carlisle ruled late Monday, June 19, in the third week of the inquest, that “questions of the witness will not explore the topic of racism” (quoted in Gillis 2017). That decision led to an application from Black Action Defence Committee (BADC) lawyer Selwyn Pieters requesting a reconsideration. Pieters’ application asked that McKenzie “be permitted to testify in respect to racism&#8230;particularly systemic and institutional racism” (quoted in Shahzad 2017). In his words: “It is a manifest error in the context of this case to speak of implicit bias and exclude racism. Racism is the elephant in the room in this case” (quoted in Gillis 2017). Implicit bias had been addressed by psychology professor Dr. Nicholas Rule in the inquest’s second week, but institutional racism itself had not been explicitly discussed.</p>
<p>Dr. Carlisle’s ruling was not overturned but council reached an agreement that discussion of institutional racism would not be prohibited. In Pieter’s words: “Today, the witness was able to be questioned unimpeded and to delve into the issue of racism, and anti-Black racism, and I think we made some headway” (quoted in Gillis 2017). He continued: “Dr. McKenzie was able to give us evidence unimpeded in respect to racism and what institutional structures need to be changed in order to foster a culturally inclusive environment that is free from racism” (quoted in Shahzad 2017).</p>
<p>For his part, when questioned about institutional racism at the inquest, Dr. McKenzie noted that “training by itself won’t make the difference&#8230;more has to happen throughout the institution” (quoted in Shahzad 2017). Yet policing in Canada is founded in colonial and racist violence. Policing institutions have had generations to change but no impetus to do so.</p>
<p>Idil Abdillahi, a former board chair for Across Boundaries, concluded: “We can’t ignore that this man was a Black man. This active refusal to engage race and racism is what we see playing out here” (quoted in Gillis 2017). It is the racism at the heart of policing in Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>Haim Queroub, the second cop in the Toronto police killing of Andrew Loku, finally spoke publicly during the coroner’s inquest into Loku’s death. Queroub, had been on the force only 11 weeks when he and shooter Andrew Doyle encountered and killed Andrew Loku in the hallway outside his apartment on July 5, 2015. Queroub used his time on the stand to hint that Loku’s  death was a “suicide by cop.”</p>
<p>Queroub testified that when he and officer Doyle shouted at Andrew Loku, the distressed man said, “What ya gonna do &#8230; Come on &#8230; Shoot me.” Here Queroub is trying to plant the notion of suicide by cop, a bogus excuse that killer cops and their police associations routinely use to be let off for killing civilians under a range of situations which are not suicides. Yet, as lawyers at the inquest pointed out these words could well have been spoken as questions (asking if the cops were seriously going to kill him for standing outside his apartment with a hammer). Queroub said he could not clarify whether the words he believes he heard were actually a question. Clearly in raising this, though, he is attempting to present the possibility of &#8220;suicide by cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Queroub’s testimony did confirm that the two officers had no discussion about nor plan to pursue de-escalation or to address someone potentially in distress. Incredibly both officers testified that they talked about how to get to the scene but not what they would do once they got there. There was no dialogue with Loku. Instead he was shot and killed within 21 seconds of police encountering him.</p>
<p>Clearly, as critics have suggested, police training is not the issue. Queroub testified he had received training both on interacting with people with mental health issues and on implicit bias when dealing with racialized people and communities. He even testified he had received de-escalation training. Yet <em>none</em> of these came into use when officers Queroub and Doyle encountered Andrew Loku and chose to shoot him within a mere 21 seconds. Queroub testified he did not even consider the man’s  distress or how to deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>And he concluded that if he had to do it over again, he would not change anything. Police do not need to because they will not be held to account for killing civilians. And they know it. Instead phony “suicide by cop” claims, or other measures, will be used to get them off or help them to sleep at night.</p>
       *<p>Finally, nearly two years after Toronto police gunned down Andrew Loku, Constable Andrew Doyle has been identified publicly as the officer who pulled the trigger. Doyle took the stand Wednesday, June 14, 2017, during the second week of testimony in the coroner’s inquest into Loku’s killing by police. Doyle and Haim Queroub had only been identified as the officers involved in Loku’s killing during a previous session of the current inquest. The one who did the shooting had not been identified.</p>
<p>Doyle raised his firearm, pointing it at Loku, almost immediately upon encountering the man, a refugee from South Sudan. Evidence presented previously at the inquest, including the surveillance video of the encounter, shows that Loku was shot within 19 seconds of officers Andrew Doyle  and Haim Queroub encountering him. Earlier testimony from psychology professor Nicholas Rule shows implicit bias against Black men in Canadian and US contexts, including increased perceptions of threat. Community groups want the inquest to address issues of racism in the very quick deployment of lethal force against Andrew Loku, who witnesses and video suggest was not actively threatening the officers.</p>
<p>On the stand officer Doyle said coldly: “We’re trained to stop the threat. Two rounds stops the threat. He immediately fell to the ground. There was no need for anything else.”  Doyle said he had no training in alternative methods to disarm the man. Despite the blood pooling under Andrew Loku’s body, Doyle said his main concern was to make sure the dead man did not have another weapon.</p>
       *<p>Coroner’s inquests in the Canadian context never get to the heart of issues like racism and policing let along fundamental structures of policing like policing and white supremacy or policing and colonialism. Such inquests are generally limited to the specific actions of a particular event. The coroner’s inquest into the Toronto police killing of Andrew Loku, a refugee from  Sudan who suffered PTSD as a result of being kidnapped and tortured there, will likely be no different. Still community groups like the Black Action Defence Committee, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Empowerment Council, and Across Boundaries, a group that provides mental health support for racialized communities in Toronto, are working to ensure larger issues of racialization, racism, and mental health are at least addressed. They have secured participant status.</p>
<p>On Monday, June 12, 2017, at the beginning of the inquest’s second week, the jury heard testimony from Dr. Nicholas Rule, an associate professor of psychology, and Canada Research Chair in social perception and cognition at the University of Toronto who carries out research on implicit bias. Rule was designated as an expert in social perception and cognition for the inquest. Dr. Rule’s testimony focused on issues related to implicit bias involving race or mental health status, and how this might impact the decisions made by police officers in the course of policing. According to Rule’s research, as given in his testimony to the inquest, implicit bias can make a young Black man appear taller, heavier, and, thus, more dangerous. According to Rule, this distortion of reality can affect both white people and Black people.</p>
<p>Rule presented results of research undertaken with two American academic colleagues examining the impact of race on the often very quick judgments people make in assessing others whom they encounter. That study, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> earlier in 2017, examined people’s perceptions of Black men in terms of their size and, presumably relatedly, their threat level. The study, which included Canadian and American participants of a variety of racialized identities presented with a series of tests, concluded that regardless of their own “race,” participants perceived Black men as taller, heavier, more muscular, and more physically threatening than white men.</p>
<p>According to the researchers: “Black men tend to be stereotyped as threatening and, as a result, may be disproportionately targeted by police even when unarmed. Here, we found evidence that biased perceptions of young Black men’s physical size may play a role in this process” (Wilson, Hugenberg, and Rule 2017). Rule noted at the inquest that the participants in the study were not identified as police officers. The researchers did not examine possible intersections of racism and presence of a weapon.</p>
<p>It is likely that the notion of implicit bias is as far as the inquest will get in terms of addressing issues of and related to racism. The ongoing histories of white supremacy and colonialism in Canadian policing will likely not be on the agenda.</p>
<p>During the first week of the inquest, Toronto Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub were finally identified as the officers involved in killing Andrew Loku, thought which one pulled the trigger has not yet been revealed publicly. Both officers are expected to testify later during this second week of the inquest.</p>

       *<p>The Toronto police officers who killed Andrew Loku on July 5, 2015, have finally been identified as Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub. They were named as the officer’s involved on July 9, 2017, during the coroner’s  inquest into Loku’s killing when police lawyer Gary Clewley asked the men to rise from their seats to be identified by a witness. Even now, however, it was not said which of the two officers shot Loku. That identification is, after all this time, expected to come during the second week of the inquest when the officers are set to testify.</p>
<p>Video surveillance footage of events prior to the shooting of Loku in the hallway outside his apartment shows that he was not threatening his neighbors as he has been accused of. The neighbors do not appear afraid of him and some speak with him though there is no audio in the footage. Neighbor and witness Robin Hicks claimed on the stand that she was afraid <em>for</em> Loku not <em>of</em> Loku when police arrived. The footage also shows Loku holding a hammer in a manner that does not appear to be threatening (not fully by the handle).</p>
<p>Still, police shot and killed Andrew Loku within 19 seconds of encountering him and within only five minutes of the 911 call that apparently brought them. Because the state protects the state, the killer cops Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub have already been cleared by the Special Investigations Unit.</p>
       *<p>The coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Andrew Loku began in Toronto on Monday, June 5, 2017. Loku, a 45-year-old refugee from South Sudan who struggled with mental health issues after having been kidnapped and tortured there, was shot and killed by Toronto police as he stood in his apartment hallway on July 5, 2015. On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the 911 call that preceded his killing was released as part of the inquest.</p>
<p>The call reveals that police waited no more than 19 seconds after encountering Loku before shooting and killing him. He had stood in the hallway without harming anyone for at least four minutes and forty seconds before police arrived. The two officers, one a coach and the other a new recruit with only a few months on the job, are immediately heard on the tape telling Loku to drop his perceived weapon, a hammer he held at his side.  Indistinct noises, mostly yelling by police, follow over the 19 seconds. And then. Two very distinct gunshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 caller, distraught: “Oh, my god. Oh, my god.”</p>
<p>The 911 operator: “What was that?”</p>
<p>The caller: “That was gunshots. Gunshots from the police officer.”</p>
<p>A male voice then breaks through telling everyone to stay in their apartments. This is repeated by the operator.</p>
<p>Then the caller, in pained recognition: “They killed him?”</p>
<p>The operator: “Oh, my. What?”</p>
<p>Then, sadly, a child, softly: “He’s dead?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, violent force was first and foremost on the officers’ minds. There was no, even minimal, attempt to interact humanly with Andrew Loku. Never mind de-escalation, because the police were the only ones to escalate in the first place. Nineteen seconds was all they gave him.</p>

When he resisted an officer reached to grab the keys, but Perreault grabbed the officer's arm and pulled him into the car through the window, an independent investigation found. A second officer ran over to help but when he heard ""gun"" both took cover. When one of the officers slipped and fell near the back of the car Perreault got out with a sawed-off shotgun and shot the officer in the leg. The other officer fired multiple rounds, striking Perreault once in the head.       *<p>Michael David Perrault (31) was shot and killed by Edmonton Police Constable Wayne Haltli on May 18, 2015, during a traffic stop. A fatality inquiry that wrapped up over the last week of February 2018 made several recommendations focusing on the need to make crisis intervention and de-escalation training mandatory for police officers in Alberta. It was also recommended that Edmonton police pursue the “zero death” mandate arising from the inquiry into the killing of Sammy Yatim by Toronto police officer James Forcillo. Police are not required to adopt any of the recommendations and as is typically the case in such circumstances in Canada they will not do so here.</p>
<p>The inquiry reported that Michael David Perreault was in mental health crisis at the time police encountered and killed him. The inquiry also reported he had a long history of mental health issues and substance use troubles which may have been exacerbated by the health care system and doctors. He had been prescribed medications for a range of issues including depression and chronic pain from a number of accidents and workplace injuries.</p>
<p>Constable Haltli and his partner, Constable Jeffrey Park, were members of Edmonton’s Specialized Traffic Apprehension Team (STAT) when they responded to a 911 report of a suspected impaired driver in the city’s Beverly neighbourhood. Perreault’s car had stopped in the curb lane on Victoria Trail near 118 Avenue when the constables approached it. Constable Park reportedly reached into the car to try to take the keys out of the ignition when Perreault allegedly grabbed his arm. Park punched Perreault in the head several times during the encounter. It is alleged that at some point Perrault retrieved a shotgun and managed to shoot Park in the leg. It is claimed that he excited the vehicle when he was shot in the head and killed by Constable Haltli.</p>
<p>An investigation by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, had already cleared the officers. ASIRT found, not surprisingly given their history,  that the officers used reasonable force. No further word on whether punching someone repeatedly in the head over a traffic stop is reasonable force. Or a reasonable way to treat someone in distress.</p>
<p>Notably, Perrault had been targeted numerous times by Edmonton police officers and, perhaps quite justifiably, felt “cops hated him” and had singled him out for scrutiny, according to the inquiry report. The day of his killing he was apparently concerned that police were outside his home.</p>

The first officer to arrive on scene told the investigation that Baker refused commands to drop the knife, and instead threatened to stab the officer. When Baker approached, the officer fired at him several times and he was pronounced dead in hospital. No charges were laid against the officer, but his family is suing the police for $6 million.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>It happens far too often in Canada. A person experiences emotional distress or mental health issues. Someone observing contacts authorities. Rather than a health care worker, police are sent to the scene. Instead of acting in a helpful caring way, they quickly resort to orders and violence. And someone who could and should be supported ends up dead. Police who kill people under such circumstances are almost never held accountable by the criminal justice system. Now families may be beginning to turn attention to the violation of human rights that occurs when someone suffering mental illness is treated with violence because they are suffering mental illness or distress.</p>
<p>On April 2, 2015, Waterloo Regional police in Kitchener, Ontario shot Beau Baker seven times, killing him. At the time police engaged him Baker was suffering through a mental health crisis. Police were aware of this but still did nothing to calm him or deescalate or involve mental health care workers. Rather they took the typical authoritarian command approach that has led to numerous documented injuries and deaths at the hands of police in Canada. As family lawyer Davin Charney suggests: “That type of command (approach) doesn’t work for people in a mental crisis” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mental Health and Human Rights Violations by Police</p>
<p>Police in Canada have a dubious history of killing people experiencing mental health crises. The too often employed response is one of confrontation, order, escalation, and, finally, force, often times lethal. Approaches that acknowledge distress and seek communicative alternatives are rarely used. And outcomes are predictably deadly. As Charney notes: “It’s playing out across the country again and again. Beau did not deserve to die” (quoted in Sher 2016). It seems to have become too easy for police to quickly resort to lethal force in such cases. With impunity.</p>
<p>Beau Baker’s mental illness now forms a basis for a lawsuit claiming that police discriminated against him in a way that violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Ontario Human Rights Code. On April 4, 2016, the family and estate of Beau Baker filed a six million dollar lawsuit claiming that the young man was killed by Waterloo Regional police without provocation and in violation of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit further charges that the police knew that Baker was mentally ill when they encountered him and then tried to cover up their misdeed. The lawsuit also names Waterloo Regional police Chief Brian Larkin and the police services board as defendants.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the 20-year-old victim was standing with his arms above his head, holding a beer in one hand and a knife in the other, when one of two police officers who had guns pointed at him fired seven times, with one bullet severing his aorta, killing him. According to the lawsuit’s statement of claim: “(Beau) was not moving towards either officer. After he was shot, Beau fell to the ground in the exact same spot that he had been standing when the first officer had arrived” (quoted in Sher 2016). This is supported by eyewitness testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not So Special Investigations</p>
<p>In response to notice of the lawsuit, Waterloo Regional police Staff Sgt. Mike Haffner issued a statement: “Any death in our community is tragic. With the loss by the Baker family, they have decided to take legal action against the service. It would be inappropriate for the service to comment as this process has just commenced” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>As is typically the case in the Canadian context details of the killing, including the names of officers involved have not been revealed to the family or the public. This is an issue that deeply troubles critics as well as advocates for public transparency and openness in government and public institutions. Transparency and openness are by no means hallmarks of policing in Canada. Indeed secrecy, protections, and the blue wall of silence (reinforced by public agencies like the SIU) are the order of the day. In this the often self-congratulatory Canadian systems could learn from examples in the United States in which officers are named publicly, often fairly soon after an incident of police violence.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the provincial agency that investigates cases of police encounters that involve civilian injury or death, had assigned eight investigators to probe the shooting. It is by now well established, through reviews and reports released by the provincial ombudsperson, that police obstruct, deceive, and lie to the SIU. The lawsuit in this case claims that officers did not provide truthful statements to the SIU investigators. According to the lawsuit: “The officers made false and self-serving statements to the SIU with the purpose of avoiding criminal liability. The [officers] intentionally misled the SIU and corrupted the investigation into the death of Beau” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>The SIU concluded that the officer who fired the shots and killed Baker was justified in doing so. This conclusion was based on the reports of officers. In what can only be described as a perverse, even sadistic, assessment, the SIU went so far as to claim that the officer who killed Baker was justified in firing seven shots because the young victim did not fall until the last shot was fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative Views</p>
<p>Yet the perspectives and testimony of witnesses suggest something other than the SIU sanctioned version of events. Witness Muhammad Zafar, 46, reported seeing the shooting from his cousin’s apartment across the street. In his view: “There was a guy with a knife in front of the building. It looked like a kitchen knife. He was saying something and police were also saying something” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).</p>
<p>Another witness Dan Mazurek said he saw the shooting from the vantage point of his fourth-floor balcony. He reported the killing as follows: “A lady who lived in the apartment, who was a friend of the guy who got (shot), she was yelling and crying to the cop to not shoot him. I saw the cop with his gun drawn and this guy sitting on the ground” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a). According to Mazurek, he heard five gunshots from the officer, who was standing about three to 4 1/2 meters from the victim.</p>
<p>Notably, Mazurek reported that Baker was never close to the officer. He also noted that there was no attempt by police at de-escalation and the shooting came very early into the encounter. In Mazurek’s view: “The kid was nowhere near him. I did not see any [de-escalation] and within two seconds onto the balcony, the cop fired off five shots. There was another female cop behind her door of the police car” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).</p>
<p>Witnesses and friends alike cannot fathom why police responded with lethal force. Those questions remain. Beau Baker’s friend Crystal Pettigrew remembered: “He’s not a violent person and he would never hurt anyone. I think everybody just wants real answers. They didn’t have to kill him” (quoted in Carruthers 2015b)</p>
<p>Another friend Gracelynn Fortin, 16, spoke with Baker an hour before he was killed by Waterloo police. She echoes the view of others that her friend was kind and unthreatening. In her view: “Beau wouldn’t dare try and hurt someone. He was not a violent person. He was probably the most kind, caring person you could ever meet” (quoted in Carruthers 2015b). She believes that if anything he was raising a “cry for help” the night he was killed (Carruthers 2015b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While police only ever seem to see a threat, or a target, people who knew Baker recall a loving, kind artist. Indeed, according to family Beau Baker had plans to be a tattoo artist and was trying to put together the equipment to start his career. It was something at which he was said to be quite talented.</p>
<p>His mother, Jackie Baker, remembers a loving son. In her words: “Beau was one of the most thoughtful and loving people I have ever met. Since he was a young boy he made gifts for people. He bought me a rose for one of my birthdays and I still have the petals” (quoted in Sher 2016). She suggests that her son’s battles with anxiety worsened following the death in 2011 of a grandmother who was his best friend. This led to a turn to smoking pot and eventually drinking. Jackie Baker has a chilling recollection of the last time she spent and her son spent together:</p>
<p>“The day before he was taken from his two brothers and myself I had met him at the doctor’s office to get a new prescription for his medication. I gave him a new shirt in an army green colour. We parted ways at the bus stop and I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and told him I love him. As I walked away I kept looking back for some reason.” (quoted in Sher 2016)</p>
<p>Her son is among the victims of people dealing with mental health issues who are killed by police in Canada. It is a long and troubling list. One that shows have inappropriate, and unacceptable, it is to have police intervening in cases of mental stress and illness.</p>

Police kicked the door in and found Heffernan holding a small syringe and a lighter over his head, an independent investigation found. Police shocked him twice with a stun gun to little effect. An officer then fired his stun gun at the same time another officer fired his sidearm, hitting Anthony four times. Autopsy results showed significant levels of cocaine in his system, and invesigators decided ""there was no reasonable likelihood of conviction and the recommendation was that no charges be laid against the subject officer."";    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>Anthony Heffernan was alone in his hotel room, holding a syringe, and posing no threat to the public or police, when Calgary police officers broke down the door to the room, burst in, and shot the 27-year-old four times, twice in the head. The officer in question fired six time in total that day in March 2015. The syringe Heffernan was holding had no needle attached. Despite the fact that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines case of police harm to civilians in Alberta, found that there were grounds to charge the officer responsible criminally, the Crown prosecutors decided not to lay charges.</p>
<p>On January 10, 2018, Anthony Heffernan’s parents found out that their bid to have a judicial review of the decision not to lay charges in the case was not granted. Court of Queen’s Bench Justice John Henderson ruled that there is no evidence to support the parents’ allegation that there was an abuse of process by the Crown.</p>
<p>This does not answer why the Crown chose not to follow the ASIRT recommendation to charge the officer nor does it explain how breaking down a door and firing six shots at someone for holding a piece of plastic is justifiable or reasonable force, or does anything to protect the public. The state protects the state.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family had argued that the officer fired recklessly and wildly. They have filed a lawsuit against the police service.</p>
<p>The Calgary police force had been involved in six fatal police shootings over two years in 2015 and 2016.</p>
       *<p>As has been documented numerous times on this site the families of people killed by police in Canada are routinely denied even basic information about the police actions in which their loved ones were killed. This includes information about the officers directly responsible for the killings. The situation is not addressed through provincial investigation units since killer cops are not required to provide statements to such units and, of course, typically choose not to.  Thus families are left with no recourse but to file lawsuits against killer cops and the forces that protect them in order to gain even basic insights into the events that took their loved ones’ lives.</p>
<p>The family of Anthony Heffernan, killed by a multiple killer cop two years ago, has had to take the route of a lawsuit against the Calgary Police Service (CPS) in an attempt to find answers that have so far been denied to them. They also hope the lawsuit will result in changes to the department and prevent similar killings. The lawsuit is seeking $225,000 to cover the cost of Anthony Heffernan’s funeral, lost wages, and grief counseling required by the family. In August of 2016, the Heffernan family found out that the officer who killed Anthony would not face any charges. A statement of claim in the lawsuit argues there “was an excessive and unlawful use of force” in Anthony Heffernan’s killing. In the lawsuit the family also claim that some or all of the service members involved in the incident created notes and reports that were “false, misleading, containing omissions or exaggerations” (quoted in Potkin 2017). The family is also appealing the decision not to bring charges.</p>
<p>Anthony Heffernan was tasered and shot four times and killed by an officer after police broke into the hotel room in which the young man was staying in the city’s northeast in March 2015. All of this happened within 72 seconds of police entering the room (Potkins 2017). He was alone in the room and posed no threat to anyone outside the room, certainly he posed no threat to the public. He did not leave the room and posed no threat officers or anyone else in the hallway. The officer who killed Anthony Heffernan was not suspended and killed another man while on duty only a few months after the Heffernan killing.</p>
<p>Grant Heffernan, Anthony’s brother, explains the lawsuit as follows: “The point is we want is police accountability for their actions. It’s not about the money. It’s about hopefully going to trial and getting unanswered questions that we’ve had from the beginning” (quoted in CTV 2017).</p>
<p>The defendants listed in the lawsuit include former interim police chief Paul Cook along with five CPS members. Four of the officers are identified as John Doe while one officer is identified as Constable McLoughlin (no first name), said to be the killer cop. Patrick Heffernan, Anthony’s father, notes that police have never identified who the five officers at and the family only learned the surname of the killer cop McLoughlin through ASIRT (Potkin 2017).</p>
<p>In yet another of the numerous cases in which the courts protect killer cops, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) ruled that there was potential for charges in the killing of Anthony Heffernan only to see prosecutors not bring charges because they were of the view that there was  “no reasonable likelihood of conviction” (Potkins 2017). ASIRT concluded that Heffernan had his hands in the air at the time police shot and killed him.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family notes, with disappointment, that while the ASIRT investigation included statements from four of the officers in the room when Anthony was killed it did not include statements from the officer who killed their loved one. While they, like other family members of victims of police killings, cannot believe this was not part of the investigation it is, in fact a protection all killer cops enjoy.</p>
<p>The family hopes that the civil suit will finally ensure that the officer provides a first-hand account of why he shot Anthony multiple times.</p>

       *<p>In the Canadian state context it is exceedingly rare for police who kill civilians to be charged with a criminal offence, no matter how egregious or obviously criminal their actions are. Often times so-called oversight agencies will exonerate the officers (sometimes because they do not receive full or proper disclosure from obstructionist forces or police associations, as the Ontario Ombudsperson has reported). In other cases the Crown will operate to shield officers who kill by refusing to bring charges even where the oversight agency has found evidence of wrongdoing by police. By refusing to bring charges the Crown acts to protect killer police officers from having to defend their actions in court and foreclosing even the possibility of conviction. The decision to withhold charges also deprives the public, and family members of the victim, from learning the identity of the officers responsible as the bringing of charges is often the only mechanism by which the identities of killer police officers are revealed publicly. Given the close associations and mutual professional benefits of positive relations between police and prosecutors (and the more straightforward interest of the state in defending its own operators) the choice of prosecutors not to charge police even in cases of apparent wrongdoing is not overly surprising.</p>
<p>Yet it is still disappointing particularly for friends and family members of victims and for community advocates. Another such disappointing case of prosecutorial shielding of police came out of Alberta on August 22, 2016 when the Crown prosecutor chose not to bring charges against the officers who killed Anthony Heffernan (27) in 2015, despite the fact that the provincial oversight body, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), found evidence of police wrongdoing through their investigation. Incredibly, the officer who killed Anthony Heffernan has since gone on to kill another man, Dave McQueen, a man in a wheelchair, in 2016. Tellingly the killing of Anthony Heffernan was the closest any police officer has come to being criminally charged for killing someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die Policing Again: The Killing of Anthony Heffernan</p>
<p>Anthony Heffernan was a young man experiencing addiction and mental health issues who was shot multiple times and killed by police despite the fact that he was confined to a room in a Super 8 motel and posed no immediate danger to anyone but perhaps himself. Heffernan suffered three shots to the neck and head. The ASIRT report found that police could Heffernan through the partially opened hotel room door and they described him as “flushed, non-responsive and hyperventilating” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Police described the victim as being “in medical distress” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016) but there is no proper explanation as to why the response of officers was to shoot someone in distress, and confined to an enclosed space, multiple times. Heffernan was only holding a “small diabetic needle” with no point on it and a lighter. The entire incident lasted only 72 seconds. In that short amount of time police encountered, engaged, and killed a young man in distress and confined to a room.</p>
<p>This appears to be yet another case of “comply or die” policing in which someone is killed simply because they do not fulfill the authoritarian wishes of officers shouting commands. Indeed, in this case officers asserted that they shot Heffernan because he did not comply with their orders to drop the needle and lighter. A steep price to pay, summary execution, for failing to satisfy the authoritarian desires of police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Protecting State</p>
<p>The ASIRT report said that although “there is evidence capable of providing reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or offences have been committed, the Crown opinion has determined that the case does not meet the standard for prosecution” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016). The family finds this twist of logic to be “shocking.”</p>
<p>To excuse their decision not to bring charges the Crown prosecutors, perhaps trying to defuse criticism of their controversial choice released a lengthy statement. It read in part:</p>
<p>“The evidence would be that he did so as a defensive action against an individual who was armed with a syringe, and who had been either unwilling or unable to comply with police directions.</p>
<p>“In all of these circumstances, it could not be disproven that the subject officer acted upon a reasonable belief that he and the other officers were at risk of serious or grievous bodily harm, and that his use of force was necessary.” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calgary Chief of Police Roger Chaffin responded by saying he stands by his officer despite noting that he has been reassigned while working “through his own, particular issues” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Notably the Chief of Police in Calgary has been so concerned with improper behavior in the force that he has gone on a public witch hunt against whistleblowers in the department who have spoken out against misconduct or named officers involved.</p>
<p>The lawyer for the Heffernan family, Tom Engel, notes that the officer involved in the shooting exercised his right to remain silent during the ASIRT investigation and refused even to give the police oversight agency his notes. This is an incredible privilege given police but denied civilians. It is one reason among many that so-called independent oversight agencies have been so ineffectual (or effective in shielding police) in every provincial context within the Canadian state. Notably, again, not bringing charges protects the officers from having to testify and hand over their notes so the Crown, even in this way, is protecting the officers from necessary public scrutiny regardless of a conviction or not.</p>
<p>The family is planning a civil suit against the police. This is often the last resort option to which families must turn simply to learn the names of officers involved in killing their loved one. In this case the family is hoping that the civil suit against Calgary Police Services and the officers who were in the Super 8 motel room will have to testify and turn over the notes. According to Tom Engel: “It just seemed that, with all those police officers in the room with all that fire power &#8230; [Anthony] was shot having nothing but a lighter in his hand and possibly approaching the officers, it’s a stretch to say it was a justifiable homicide” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016).</p>
<p>Engel also points out the double standard that exists because officers are allowed to stay silent and keep their notes under the Police Act. Indeed officers are rarely if ever arrested when they kill someone, even under dubious circumstances. In Engel’s view:</p>
<p>“If the tables were reversed and Anthony Heffernan had killed a police officer, they would have arrested him on the spot and had him in for an intensive interrogation trying to break down his will to remain silent. But that’s not the case with a police officer, they don’t arrest him, they carry on an investigation for months or even years.” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016)</p>
<p>In the case of a civil suit or fatality inquiry the officers would be compelled to testify and would have to turn over the notes. The officers were the only witnesses to the killing and their stories about what happened actually differed in key areas such as the movements of Heffernan before he was shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone in Contact with Police is at Tremendous Risk: the Family Responds</p>
<p>The family was devastated by the Crown decision. Given the circumstances around the killing of Anthony Heffernan they expected the bringing of a rare charge of murder against the officer responsible (who would kill again earlier this year). Anthony Heffernan&#8217;s mother, Irene, had hoped “clear and just thinking would prevail, but it didn’t” (quoted in 2016). Heffernan’s father Pat says his son’s killing shows that people are at risk any time they come into contact with police. In his words: “It’s a sad day for all Albertans and Canadians alike. There is no justice in this case. Anthony is dead, and anyone else who comes into contact with police is at tremendous risk &#8230; because they [officers] are going to be supporting each other in whatever needs to be said” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016).</p>
<p>This is another case that begs us to ask deeper questions about why police are called in the first place. It raises the effects of social isolation and moral panics, around drug use or mental health, which lead people to call police for behavior that is not harming anyone but may be unusual or disturbing. This is a matter manufactured fear and dependence on authorities. And it ends with someone dead at the hands of police upset that their orders have not been obeyed and trained to shoot first, second, and always. And knowing they will not be held accountable for the great harm they do, for the lives they destroy.</p>

       *<p>In the Canadian state context there are few legal outcomes as rare as a police officer being convicted for killing a civilian. It is rare enough that an officer who kills someone is even charged for the taking of someone’s life. This is true even in those provinces that have separate investigations units that look into killings by police rather than simply turning a case over to another police force to “investigate.” Indeed as the recent decision by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) not to bring charges in the police killing of Andrew Loku and ongoing criticisms of the backlogged Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia show, these agencies remain limited, and often impede by or too close to, police departments involved in killings. The Loku killing in particular has led to community mobilizations by Black Lives Matter Toronto and allies.</p>
<p>Still it is safe to assume that most residents of provinces that have a dedicated unit that investigates police killings of civilians, like Alberta, would expect that any officer involved in killing a civilian would, at the very least, be taken off of active street duty while under investigation or before any conclusions are released to the public. If an officer may have acted inappropriately, unduly, disgracefully it would only make sense that they would not be released upon the public until review of the officer, their outlook, and conduct was completed and some assessment made. Surely a killer cop would not be turned out on the streets to kill again.</p>
<p>Well, incredibly, stunningly, it seems that just such a situation has been allowed to happen in Alberta with, perhaps predictably, lethal consequences. On January 25, 2016 David McQueen, a quadriplegic, was shot by three Calgary police officers while in his wheelchair inside the doorway to his house. In March 2016 it was revealed that one of the officers who shot McQueen was, at the very moment he fired his weapon, under investigation by the province’s investigation unit ASIRT (Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) for killing another man a year earlier. And he had not been cleared of wrongdoing in the previous killing.</p>
<p>Less than a year before, on March 16, 2015, the officer who would be involved in McQueen’s killing, had shot Anthony Heffernan four times, three times in the head, while the young man was alone and in some distress, but defenseless, in a hotel room. In fact police broke down the door to forcibly enter Heffernan’s room in a Hotel 8 before shooting him.</p>
<p>Said Grant Heffernan, Anthony’s brother, upon hearing the news that the very cop who killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;I am more than outraged that this happened to somebody else in Calgary” (quoted in Grant 2016). The family had been told by ASIRT that as of November 2015 the officer had not returned to work but was actively trying to get back on the job (Grant 2016). Heffernan suggests that family could have dealt with the officer being placed on administrative duty, though they by no means saw this as ideal in the circumstances (Grant 2016). They were shocked that he had been returned to the streets. As Grant Heffernan said upon hearing that the same officer that killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;This is unfathomable that this happened and is totally unacceptable&#8221; (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>The Heffernan family lawyer echoed those sentiments. Tom Engel, commenting on the return of the officer to street duty ahead of being cleared by ASIRT and the Alberta Crown prosecutor:  &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s shocking. You have to respect the presumption of innocence. I don&#8217;t think that you should necessarily suspend the officer from all police duties, but you certainly would take him off the street so that he wouldn&#8217;t be in a position to do that again&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>
<p>There are many questions to be answered in trying to figure out how a young man missing his check-out time could escalate so quickly to his being shot and killed by police. When he had no weapon and no capacity to harm the public (being isolated in a hotel room by himself).</p>
<p>There are also significant questions about how and why an officer under review for a killing of a civilian could be out on the streets to kill again. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, he or she is placed on a minimum 30 day administrative leave. At the end of that period, an evaluation is supposed to be undertaken to determine whether the officer can return to active duty and whether restrictions, and what type of restrictions, will be placed on them following their return. In this case it is not yet clear why the officer was allowed to return to the streets and what, if any, restrictions governed their activity.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 17, 2016, the Heffernan family reported that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has finally told them that it has recommended murder charges. The decision to lay charges rests with the Crown prosecutors. In Grant Heffernan’s words: &#8220;ASIRT is pressing hard,&#8221; (Stark 2016). This is, of course, welcome news. Charges are, as we have noted, rarely laid against officers who kill civilians, even in instances where the case would appear straightforwardly to demand charges be brought.</p>
<p>The news from ASIRT has brought some comfort to the family. Grant Heffernan suggests it is helping their recovery: &#8220;I feel a little better about it. We were very skeptical about ASIRT and any officer being charged&#8221; (quoted in Stark 2016). The family will not know until May 1 whether the Crown will, in fact, follow through and lay charges against the officer.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the police have not responded formally to this news they did offer a rather arrogant, and perhaps knowingly confident, expression of their awareness that no homicide charges have ever been laid against a Calgary police officer (Stark 2016). Such has been too consistent practice in Canada when police brutalize or kill civilians.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family has filed a complaint under the Police Act. That case can go before the law enforcement review board even if charges are not formally laid against the officer (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>For Grant Heffernan there is only one appropriate outcome. That is to ensure that the cop cannot kill a third time. In his words: &#8220;The only way there is going to be any accountability and justice, is if the subject officer who killed my brother &#8230; faces criminal prosecution&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>

<p>Michel Vienneau, a 51-year-old Tracadie resident, was shot and killed in a Bathurst Via Rail parking lot on January 12, 2015 after the two officers, who may not have been clearly identified, attempted to detain him. The police were acting on an anonymous tip that Vienneau was carrying “a load of drugs” with him as he returned from Montreal with his partner Annick Basque. The tip proved to be completely false and Vienneau had no criminal record. Constables Patrick Bulger and Mathieu Boudreau were charged with manslaughter by means of an unlawful act, assault with a weapon, and unlawfully pointing a firearm but were let off by provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the inquest announcement that he had requested, Nicolas Vienneau, the victim’s brother stated: “We have been living three years of hell” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). Reflecting on the pain his mother (85) and father (88) have been through, he suggested that they are still “terrorized”: “It’s terrible to live like this” (quoted in 2017). In his view: “If we can find some justice, it will not [help my little brother], but maybe it will give us a little bit of peace” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017).</p>
<p>Only days before the inquest was announced, Crown prosecutors gave notice that they would not be appealing the court decision of February 24 , 2017, in which provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman decided to drop charges against the two killer cops. The announcement by prosecutors resulted in a lifting of the publication ban on the trial and raised serious questions about the court’s actions, as we reported at the time. The Crown had sought a judicial review of Judge Dugas-Horsman’s decision, seeking to have it overruled, but Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench Justice Tracey DeWare dismissed that application in October.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vienneau reports that the family is “still in shock” over the decision not to appeal (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). He is left to ask: “How can justice allow a person to be shot dead…sitting in his car in motion, by two policemen in civilian clothes…with [an] unmarked car?” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). The short answer is that the killers were cops and in the Canadian context they are allowed to kill with impunity. But more detailed answers are needed. The family remains perplexed that civilian witnesses were not questioned during preliminary inquiry, which they view as inadequate.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vienneau plans to bring a petition to the House of Commons to have the identity of the Crime Stoppers tipster revealed. In his words: “My family still believes that the tipster of this false information…is the key to the puzzle” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017)</p>
<p>Bulger and Boudreau are still working as officers but face a professional conduct investigation by the New Brunswick Police Commission.

       *<p>Michel Vienneau, a 51-year-old man from Tracadie, New Brunswick, was shot and killed by Bathurst police officers Mathieu Boudreau (now 28) and Patrick Bulger (now 38) outside the Bathurst VIA Rail station on the morning of January 12, 2015. Despite serious questions about police killing of an innocent man under questionable circumstances, in which police had no “reasonable and probable” grounds to arrest, charges against the officers were dropped by provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman. Now that the Crown prosecutor has chosen not to appeal, the publication ban on evidence presented during the officers’ preliminary inquiry has been lifted. Emerging details raise further questions about the killer cops’ actions and the judge’s decision not to try their cases.</p>
<p>Police intercepted Vienneau as he arrived by train from a Montreal vacation with his common-law partner, Annick Basque. Police were acting on an unconfirmed and unverified anonymous tip that Vienneau was carrying an unspecified “load of drugs” back from Montreal with him. An RCMP investigation following Vienneau’s killing found that the tip was completely false. Vienneau not carrying any drugs, and he had no previous record with police. He was completely innocent of the claims made anonymously against him, yet police killed him shortly after encountering him. Constable Boudreau fired four shots at the victim who was inside his car at the time.</p>
<p>It seems that there was some pressure on Constable Bulger to make a big bust, and a concern that he might have missed it. When the tip came in just before 10 AM that morning, a supervisor is reported as saying to Bulger, “you missed a load this morning.”</p>
<p>Six police officers attended the Via Rail train station in Bathurst in three unmarked cars to intercept Vienneau. Curiously, they did not take the opportunity to arrest Vienneau immediately but instead waited until he and Basque disembarked the train, picked up their luggage and entered their vehicle.</p>
<p>Basque’s account of the police attempt to arrest Vienneau differs greatly from the one provided by the officers. She says that she did not even know that the men accosting them were police officers. When Bulger exited his car with a gun in his hands, she reports that Vienneau tried to drive by him, moving slowly. Basque suggests that when she heard gunshots her first thought was that the men were “going to kill everyone.”  Not realizing that they were police officers, she fought against her arrest until she recognized some uniformed officers.</p>
<p>The Crown’s case raised the fact that the police had no “reasonable and probable” grounds to arrest Vienneau in the first place because the tip police were acting on was unreliable and unverified. Details released reveal that the preliminary inquiry heard that less than an hour elapsed between the time police received the tip was and the time that they arrived at the train station. In fact, the tip was not investigated by police and, incredibly, several officers had not even read it fully.</p>
<p>In the decision of February 24 , 2017, provincial court Judge Dugas-Horsman stated that she simply did not feel Boudreau and Bulger had acted illegally. It seems that Judge Dugas-Horsman made several contortions of logic to let the police off. First, the judge found that &#8216;”not having reasonable and probable grounds&#8217;” for an arrest did not make for an unlawful arrest. She then said that technically an arrest never happened because, well the police killed Vienneau before he was fully under arrest (even though he was “technically” detained in his vehicle). The judge then gave officers another excuse, suggesting that officers have the right to stop vehicles under the Motor Vehicle Act. Judge Dugas-Horsman then went further offering the copaganda excuse that anyone disobeying a police order to stop (as Bulger says he did without independent confirmation of the order or whether Vienneau ever heard it if it were given). According to Dugas-Horsman (in full cop defense mode): “This failure to stop heightens the suspicion of a police officer, who is then entitled to wonder why the person is not stopping,.” The state protects the state and goes out of its way to do so in protecting killer cops.</p>
<p>The only testimony presented at the preliminary hearing, apart from that provided by Annick Basque, was provided by several police officers. The Vienneau family has raised questions about this. They ask why none of the civilians who were present at the train station were asked to provide their versions of what they witnessed that day. The family has also asked why no one has bothered to investigate where the anonymous, and false,  tip came from in the first place.</p>
       *<p>Constables Patrick Bulger (38) and Mathieu Boudreau (26) had each faced charges of manslaughter with a weapon, assault with a weapon, and unlawfully pointing a firearm for the shooting and killing of businessman Michel Vienneau on January 12, 2015 under highly questionable circumstances. The police had been given an erroneous anonymous “tip” that Vienneau was in possession of drugs when the officers confronted him outside the Bathurst, New Brunswick train station.</p>
<p>On October 20, 2017, Court of Queens Bench Judge Tracey DeWare upheld an earlier court decision dismissing the charges against the two constables. The evidence in the case still remains subject to a publication ban for at least 30 days, unless the ruling is appealed.</p>
<p>In February, provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman ruled, following a preliminary hearing, that the prosecution failed to produce enough evidence to warrant a trial. The judge dropped charges against the officers. New Brunswick’s Public Prosecutions Services challenged that ruling, arguing that the  the judge failed to consider all relevant evidence.</p>
<p>An RCMP investigation later found that Vienneau was not involved in any criminal activity. A civil lawsuit on behalf of Vienneau’s partner, who was accompanying him at the time he was killed, alleges that his death was caused by police negligence.</p>
<p>This decision is not surprising in the least since the state consistently protects the state in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
       *<p>Bathurst, New Brunswick, police officers Mathieu Boudreau and Patrick Bulger killed Michel Vienneau (51) on January 12, 2015, shooting the man outside the train station as he returned with his partner from a vacation. On February 24, 2017 Judge Camille Dugas-Horsman simply tossed the charges of manslaughter against the officers, an all too typical move by the courts to protect killer cops in cases where dubious conduct makes charges unavoidable. This decision was additionally troubling given that an RCMP investigation found that Vienneau was not involved in any illegal activity before or at the time that he was killed.</p>
<p>In response, and in outrage over that decision, “Friends of Michel Vienneau” are circulating a petition demanding that New Brunswick’s attorney general step in to order that the officers responsible stand trial in the killing. There are many questions that they want answered. Among these is why the police acted almost immediately with lethal force against a man who was not engaged in any criminal activity and who posed no threat to the public. Why did they shoot him?</p>
<p>As friend Camille Mclaughlin, who initiated the petition puts it: “For the friends of Michel Vienneau following the preliminary hearing, it was a disaster because there was no way we could see the truth in what happened. Why did they kill him instead of just check him? For drug or anything. They killed an innocent person who now has been cleared of any illegal act” (quoted in Yard 2017).</p>
<p>Another question is the identity and intentions of an anonymous tipster who called Crime Stoppers to accuse Vienneau and his partner Annick Basque of drinking and transporting drugs as they returned from a trip to Montreal. The anonymous tipster apparently gave detailed descriptions of the couple as well as providing police with the make, model, and year of the car registered to Vienneau (Yard 2017). Vienneau’s brother, Nicolas Vienneau, questions the nature of the Crime Stoppers tip  and wants the name of the tipster revealed publicly.</p>
<p>The petition, “Justice pour Michel Vienneau homme d&#8217;affaires tué par la police le 12 jan. 2015 à Bathurst,” can be found at change.org. It reads in part:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We, the undersigned, request that Justice be done for Michel Vienneau and that a Trial be held to explain to the public why the police have committed such a shameful and brutal gesture at the Bathurst Station to commit a murder of an innocent businessman who wasn’t involved in any illegal act, rather than simply intercept it. The conclusion of the Preliminary Hearing in the case implicitly indicates that the police can now commit murders and assassinations on anyone without any consequence for their actions on their part. Transparency in this matter is very important and crucial in order to make the population aware of why the police have acted in this way.</p>
<p>“We, the undersigned, ask the Attorney General of New Brunswick, Serge Rousselle, to force a Trial for True Justice for Michel Vienneau’s family and friends.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vienneau’s niece, Nikki, saying Judge Dugas-Horsman’s decision has devastated the family, supports the petition and speaks of its importance to the family: “For us it’s important thing that a lot of people agree with us that this has to go on. We&#8217;re still on it. Michel is not here with us but somebody has to do the work” (quoted in Yard 2017). Vienneau’s parents, in ill health, have been hit hard by the killing of their son and by the actions of the court.</p>

       *<p>In the Canadian context, whether dealing with federal, provincial or municipal forces, it is extremely rare for police to be held in any way accountable when they kill people. On Thursday, November 19, 2015 one of those exceptional instances occurred when it was announced that two officers from the police force of Bathurst, New Brunswick have been charged in connection with the police killing of Michel Vienneau (51) on January 12 of the same year.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia RCMP, the force which had been charged with reviewing the case, announced that Constable Patrick Bulger, 38, of Beresford, and Constable Mathieu Boudreau, 26, of Dunlop, have each been charged with: manslaughter with a weapon; two counts of assault with a weapon; two counts of unlawfully pointing a firearm. Boudreau was identified as the officer who fired several times killing Vienneau. Both officers are to appear in provincial court in Bathurst on Jan. 4, 2016.</p>
<p>Vienneau was returning from a trip to Montréal with his partner Annick Basque when the couple were intercepted by the Bathurst police officers and shot and killed outside the city’s train station. According to court documents, Bathurst police received a Crime Stoppers tip that Vienneau would be on the train from Montréal and in possession of drugs. The Nova Scotia RCMP claimed, however, that their investigation found Vienneau not to be involved in any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia RCMP Inspector Larry Wilson met with media in Bathurst on Thursday but refused to answer many questions asked by reporters on grounds that the case was now before the courts. The New Brunswick Police Commission also announced on Thursday that Bathurst police Chief Eugène Poitras had filed a conduct complaint against the two officers charged in the shooting of Vienneau. That case was to be investigated by Moncton lawyer Judith Beglay but has now been suspended following the completion of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The two officers have been suspended but the Police Act conveniently allows only for suspensions with pay.</p>

<p>What has been reported is that Naverone Woods entered a Safeway grocery store in the Whalley area in north Surrey, near the Skytrain, around 8 AM on December 28, 2014. Customers and staff either at the grocery store or a nearby convenience store reportedly called 911. Two officers from the Metro Vancouver Transit Police, an armed transit force, the first of its kind in Canada, entered the store and in the ensuing encounter one officer shot and killed Woods.

Things escalated when two officers pulled up and yelled across the intersection for him to drop the wood and come toward them. Witnesses said they heard four gunshots after Du walked into the street. An inquest heard that Du was a gambling addict who had been barred from casinos and had lived with schizophrenia for more than 25 years.;    Fatal police shooting.; ; Police custody; Police custody; ""Formally diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia."";    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>It has been announced that the BC Coroners Service will hold a public inquest into the fatal shooting of 51-year-old Phuong Na (Tony) Du by Vancouver police in 2014. Du was killed by Vancouver Police Department (VPD) officers in public while in some psychological distress on Knight Street near 41st Avenue in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Two officers responded to calls about DU with one firing a been bag gun at him  and the other shooting him with a firearm. Du was taken to hospital where he died from the injuries inflicted by police. Du experienced mental illness.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia investigated the killing but charges were not recommended by the Criminal Justice Branch (CJB) for the two officers responsible. The CJB claimed the use of a firearm by one of the officers was justifiable on the basis of his belief that his partner’s life was in danger, despite the fact that the other officer was armed.</p>
<p>In February 2017, Tony Du’s family launched a civil suit against the City of Vancouver and the police officer who fired the fatal shot in the killing. Lawyers representing the victim’s family note that Tony Du was killed between only 18 and 25 seconds after police arrived on the scene. This time was no where near long enough for police to begin a conversation with Du let alone establish his mental condition.</p>
<p>The public inquest into the police killing of Tony Du will commence on February 5, 2018, at the Burnaby Coroners Court. As per usual, the coroner’s jury will be able to make recommendations that might prevent deaths under similar circumstances but which police are under no obligation at all to follow. The jury cannot make any finding of legal responsibility or blame and can not recommend charges against any killer cop.</p>
       *<p>Police in Canada have a horrendous history of killing civilians dealing with mental health issues. Too often police interaction with someone experiencing mental illness or distress results in a quick deployment of often lethal force. The police solution to mental illness is death. And even more police can count on investigations units and prosecutors to use the victims’ mental health against them in deciding not to charge officers who kill quickly. Identities of officers not charge remain undisclosed leaving families without even the names (or ironically without knowledge of the personal histories, including past killings) of the officers who killed their loved ones. Often families of people killed by police in Canada are forced to file lawsuits simply to receive disclosure of basic information about the killing of their family members.</p>
<p>On Thursday, February 9, 2017, the family of Phuong Na Du, Tony Du, a Vancouver man shot and killed by police in November of 2014 launched a civil suit against the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Department officer involved in the shooting. Pivot Legal, a local civil rights law group, announced the lawsuit right after the Crown prosecutor announced that the Vancouver police officer who killed Du would not be charged.</p>
<p>Tony Du experienced, who experienced schizophrenia, was killed by police after officers arrived on the scene at Knight Street near East 41st Street. Witnesses reported seeing the victim appearing distraught  and waving a two-by-four. Du was shot by one officer and hit with a bean bag round fired by another and died in hospital of the injuries inflicted by police. Police explained the decision to shoot by saying the man would not immediately comply with officers’ orders. Failure to immediately comply is too often viewed by police as an invitation to shoot and a license to kill. And investigations and prosecutors reinforce this arrogant view by refusing to bring charges against cops who kill under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The provincial oversight body, the Independent Investigations Office (which is not truly independent of police an trains through the police training center, the Justice Institute of British Columbia) investigated the killing and submitted its report to the Crown in the fall of 2016. That report disclosed that DU was shot and killed a mere 18 to 25 seconds after police arrived on the scene. This calls entirely into question, indeed refutes, the police claim that the victim had time to understand and respond to officers’ orders. This short time frame was neither long enough to start a conversation with Du nor enough time to assess his mental state or intentions. Pivot Legal lawyer Douglas King suggests that the police undertook instead “a very intense and rapid escalation” one that raises some “serious concerns” (quoted in CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Crown prosecutors are almost uniformly reluctant to charge officers given their need to work with police on cases and the perceived impact a lack of police cooperation could have on their career trajectory. So it was in no way surprising that the Criminal Justice Branch in British Columbia released a statement saying that the evidence gathered did not meet the criteria for approval of charges in connection with the police shooting death of Tony Du. Said the Crown, grimly, of the killer cop in this case: “He continued firing until the suspect was no longer a threat” (quoted in CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Indeed. And no charges result.</p>

The SIU reviews all cases in Ontario in which police officers are involved in incidents where someone is seriously injured or dies.</p>
       ***<p>In the early morning of Sunday, July 26, 2015, a 52 year old man died while being driven home from a bar in Grand Bend, Ontario by officers of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which is called in all cases of civilian injury or death involving police contact, has assigned six investigators to the case. Initial reports suggest that one officer is the subject of the investigator with a second officer designated as a witness. The name of the victim has not yet been released.</p>
       ***<p>Killing Accountability: Cop Crime, the SIU and the Blue Wall</p>
<p>Only a few police agencies in Canada are subject to any independent civilian oversight or mechanism of accountability. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario is often presented as the model example for civilian oversight of the police. The SIU oversees municipal, regional and provincial police in Ontario but does not investigate the federal police, such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) or First Nations constables or Canadian Forces Military Police. The SIU is responsible for investigating all cases in which police officers are involved in the serious injury or death of civilians.</p>
<p>Despite its place as a model for civilian oversight the SIU has, throughout its history, had a reputation of police bias or being soft on police. For almost a quarter century, the SIU has also been subject to interference, obstruction, and uncooperativeness by police agencies at all levels. A range of ongoing problems have left the SIU what some have termed a “toothless tiger.”</p>
<p>Documents obtained by the Toronto Star show that over its nearly three decade existence, the SIU has conducted at least 3400 investigations but laid criminal charges following a mere 95 of them. While the SIU does not track what happens to those it charges the Star found that only 16 officers have been convicted of a crime after a SIU investigation. Incredibly only three have seen the inside of a jail</p>
<p>Critics contend that the SIU has been regularly unable to perform its stated function as a direct result of police interference. Even more this interference and obstruction is explicitly condoned and, in many cases, even encouraged by police associations. Numerous studies and reports over the decades have found substantial evidence bearing out these concerns.</p>
<p>Then-Ontario Ombudsperson, and former SIU director, Andre Marin authored a 2008 report on the SIU entitled “Oversight Unseen” which was the subject of much attention and which generated a great deal of discussion. In it Marin identified a number of serious issues impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the SIU and calling the unit’s work into some question. Even more damning was what the report had to say about police agencies and their respect, or more accurately their lack of respect, for public oversight and accountability to the public. Marin was led to conclude that the SIU was a “toothless tiger.”<br />
The disturbing issues highlighted by Marin are numerous. They include delays in notification to SIU by police forces regarding incidents; resistance by subject and witness officers toward disclosing their notes without prior vetting by a lawyer; sharing of legal counsel by the suspect officer and witness officers; and resistance by police officers to submit to SIU interviews.</p>
<p>Critics of police conduct with regard to the SIU note that a delay in the delivery to investigators of notes and interviews with officers can produce a protracted and weakened investigation. Marin spoke to the issue of delayed notification to the SIU in a 2011 interview with newsmagazine W5. As he explained his concerns at that time: &#8220;when the legislation says immediate notification, how can you be more clear than the word immediate &#8230; if a police agency decides to call three days later, they&#8217;ll get I presume a complaint letter from the SIU which will or will not be answered. But there&#8217;s no consequence for that police agency&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011). In the 2008 report, Marin reasoned for more prompt interviews with witness officers. He reaffirmed this years later. In 2011 he asserted that &#8220;our investigation found that the problem of delayed witness officer interviews has persisted [over decades] to this day, and continues to compromise the integrity of the SIU&#8217;s investigative process&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011).</p>
<p>The impact of delays is significant and dramatic compared with a more forthright process by police. Marin suggests, for SIU investigations in which police are cooperative: &#8220;SIU cases with the right level of co-operation should always be resolved in a matter of days, not weeks and months&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011).</p>
<p>A few years after the Marin report, former Chief Justice LeSage undertook a 15-month review of the SIU and police relations. His 2011 report also called for several significant changes to investigative procedures, including the recommendation that witness officers and subject officers be prohibited from sharing legal counsel. Lesage further recommended that officers involved in a SIU investigation not be allowed to communicate with each other about the incident.</p>
<p>The root of problems facing the SIU, as for all attempts to investigate police for acts of violence and killings, as for acts of misconduct more generally, is the police themselves as an institution. More specifically is the institutional culture, a dual sense of both entitlement and misplaced victimology (being put upon by a community “out to get them”) expressed by the police. This is the infamous “blue wall” of police silence and secrecy identified and discussed by criminologists. According to Marin, &#8220;the police unions take control of the situation&#8230;they will defend and protect members regardless of whether or not they believe that person has committed a wrong doing&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011). Indeed numerous studies of the SIU have identified and highlighted the presence and impacts of the blue wall in interfering with, impeding, and negatively impacting investigatory attempts.</p>
<p>Marin&#8217;s observations echoed an earlier study on the SIU, released in 2003, for the Attorney General. In a 2003 study on the SIU, retired Justice George Adams also referenced explicitly &#8220;the difficulty for the SIU has been in dealing with the PAO [Police Association of Ontario]&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011). As recently as July, 2015 serious questions were raised following a decision not to lay charges against the officer involved in the September 2014 killing by police of Jermaine Carby (33) in Brampton, Ontario. In this case Peel Regional Police have maintained a veil of secrecy around the officer who removed a key piece of evidence from the scene of the fatal police shooting (Gallant and Gillis 2015).</p>
<p>As Marin has concluded: &#8220;The director of the SIU cannot cause consequences to happen to police agencies who thumb their nose to civilian oversight. So that&#8217;s where the rest of government needs to come in and they&#8217;ve been rather invisible through all of this&#8221; (quoted in Finlay 2011). Such are the limits of investigation of police given the nature of police institutions and their organizational and political power. The result is to allow murderous institutions significant leeway in eluding investigators and avoiding meaningful consequences for their murderous activities. They wield a power unlike any other social institution.</p>
<p>In his annual ombudsperson’s report released July 28, 2015, Marin called on the Government of Ontario to give the Special Investigations Unit more power to charge police who fail to co-operate with SIU investigations. Marin argued again that the provincial government should explicitly outlaw police from impeding SIU investigations.</p>
<p>As has been the case for governmental responses by succeeding governments, under different political party control, current Attorney-General Madeleine Meilleur (Liberal) avoided questions related to giving the SIU more power.</p>

       *<p>A court case has revealed the names of two officers in the killing of Kwasi Skene-Peters (21) in 2015 to be Constable Jeffery Riel and Constable Darryl Lambie. The names of the officers who shot at Skene-Peters were released as part of a court case involving Kevin Duro (26), who was a passenger in the car at the time of the police killing. The officers were members of the controversial and now-disbanded Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) team.</p>
<p>The names of police officers involved in killing civilians in Canada are rarely made public, typically only being revealed in coroners’ inquests, lawsuits by family members,  or court cases. Killer cops are rarely charged for their actions in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) which examines cases of police harm to civilians but does not release the names of killer cops publicly has already exonerated the officers who killed Skene-Peters. They have not confirmed that the officers named in the Duro court case are the subject officers in the Skene-Peters killing, but the court case identifies them as the two who fired shots during that event.</p>
<p>Neither subject officer spoke with the SIU or provided a copy of their notes during the investigation, a limitation of such investigations. However, they had no problem giving their accounts of the shooting in order to secure Kevin Duro’s conviction on firearms charges.</p>
       *<p>A coroner’s inquest into the police shooting and killing of 21-year-old Kwasi Skene-Peters on July 25, 2015 has been announced. On August 2, 2017, Dr. James Edwards, the regional supervising coroner for Central Region (Toronto Easy office) gave notice of the inquest.</p>
<p>An SIU (Special Investigations Unit) investigation of the killing concluded that Toronto police had been instructed to set up surveillance at the Tryst nightclub on reports that Skene-Peters would be present. The Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) (ironically) was also on hand to provide “additional officer support” and were parked in a nearby alley. Skene-Peters was in his car around 3 AM when a civilian vehicle boxed him in and police decided to make a charge on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Notably, a witness who spoke with CBC Toronto at the time reported that between 20 to 30 shots were fired and he did not hear police make any demands toward Skene-Peters before opening fire on him (CBC News 2017). Upon hearing the shots the witness fled in fear. Could a less dramatic approach by police avoided taking of a life in this case? Particularly given that Skene-Peters was in a vehicle and boxed in and police had positioning.</p>
<p>The SIU report noted that both of the officers who shot Skene-Peters declined to participate in the SIU investigation. There is currently no mechanism used to make killer cops comply with SIU investigations.</p>

<p>These fundamental questions remain to be answered in the case of the police killing of Myles Gray. This despite the pleas of family members for information. Other fundamental questions stand out with regard to police involved killings of civilians in British Columbia. So too do questions about the supposed investigations unit and civilian concerns with oversight of police in the province.</p>
<p>How is it that in a province in which there is a supposedly independent investigations unit legislatively tasked with investigating all cases in which police harm or kill a civilian there is no report years after the killing? And how is it that despite requirements that police immediately notify the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) when such occasions of force against civilians have occurred, and involved officers not communicate with one another, that there can be both a delay in notification and communications between involved officers, yet no officer is punished or in any way held accountable? And why, in British Columbia, are so many families of victims killed by police left with no answers and no insights into the events that left their loved ones dead at the hands of officers?</p>

<p>Suing for Answers in the Police Killing of Myles Gray</p>
<p>Six months after their son was killed by police, under mysterious, troubling, and still shrouded circumstances, in a backyard in Burnaby, the parents of 33 year old Myles Gray are still seeking answers. Among the few basic facts that are known about the killing of Myles Gray on the afternoon of August 13, 2015, is that officers encountered the young man after responding to a call regarding a disturbance on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. It is also known that that afternoon Myles Gray, who worked as a greenery supplier to local florist wholesalers, had argued with a woman who was watering her garden during drought restrictions. Beyond that questions abound.</p>
<p>Having received no insights into their son’s death at the hands of police they have been compelled to file a lawsuit against the Vancouver police and 11 of the force’s officers. This is the only means available to them to get an honest response from police about what happened when their son’s life was taken.</p>
<p>In addition to the Vancouver Police Department and the officers, the Grays, along with Myles Gray’s evergreen supply company, Graystone Enterprises Ltd, also name the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Board in the lawsuit. The board is cited for “failing properly and effectively to educate, train and supervise the officers to appropriate professional standards” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>In the suit, Myles Gray’s parents, Margie and Mark Gray of Sechelt, allege that seven of those officers, still identified only as “John Does,” wrongfully killed their son by beating him to death. According to the claim, the police killed Myles Gray by using “grossly excessive force” and “inflicting massive physical trauma … with no valid, lawful reason” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The suit also alleges that officers had no lawful cause or authority to detain Myles Gray and that he was repeatedly beaten, even after he had been restrained. All officers involved have been and remain on active duty since the killing.</p>
<p>Margie Gray reports being told that her son died within minutes of the encounter with Vancouver officers. Her assessment is stark, and accurate: “This is ‘comply or die’ policing. Like, what was the rush to move in and kill him?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Adds Mark Gray: “You know, they could have let him calm down …. like a person’s life is worth more than a (few) minutes, right?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The family, and indeed many reasonably thinking people, can envision a broad range of alternative approaches that could have been taken that would not have left a young man beaten to death.</p>
<p>Grieving father Mark Gray is left with the terrible question: “Why was he killed off, just hunted down like a dog, killed like a dog, worse than a dog?” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Families of almost all victims of people killed by police in Canada are provided with very little information about what the police did to their loved ones. They are almost never given the names of officers involved as these are not even made available to the general public. This is the case for Myles Gray’s parents. Their requests are straightforward and legitimate. Says Margie Gray: “I want answers. I want to know what happened that day. It&#8217;s the worst. It is horrific. And to know this went down at the hands of people you&#8217;re supposed to trust” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Known</p>
<p>The day Myles Gray would be killed by police begins routinely enough. On a hot August day, the young greenery supplier was on a regular run of deliveries to flower wholesales in the area around Boundary Road and Marine Drive in Burnaby. Sometime around 2 pm, Gray wandered away from a loading bay and walked across a small overpass above Boundary Road, a dividing line between Burnaby and Vancouver. Coming down the overpass he found himself on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. A lover of the outdoors Myles Gray often went for walks during breaks in his delivery schedule. According to ahis father he left his keys, backpack, and identification inside the delivery van and headed off in the direction of a nearby park (Olivier 2016). Based on a map of the area it is believed that Myles Gray was heading toward Everett Crowley Park on the Vancouver side of Boundary Road. A worker at the florist supply store where Gray made his delivery saw him leaving with his headphones on. They waved at each other (Olivier 2016). According to his father: “There is a little park up there. He did the loop and was heading back. And I guess he saw this lady watering her grass” (quoted in Olivier 2016). It would prove to be a fatal encounter.</p>
<p>According to a neighborhood witness, Gray and a local woman ended up in an argument as she watered her garden under conditions of drought restrictions. At the time of the encounter, Metro Vancouver was under a Stage 3 restriction on water use and this included a complete ban on watering of lawns (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>While it might not seem at all out of the ordinary for a greenery worker to be concerned about water usage on a lawn during a drought, for some reason police were called in this case. That fact raises real concerns about social disconnection, authoritarianism, and snitch tendencies within a fear culture, but these questions cannot be answered here.</p>
<p>What is clear is that 911 was called by the woman’s son and police responded (though again it might be asked why police treated an argument over lawn watering as a priority incident or why the person arguing against lawn watering during a drought was viewed as a perpetrator).</p>
<p>The woman involved has told reporters that she did indeed contact police after a verbal exchange with a man over her use of her water hose during a watering ban. She insists that she had never intended for anything bad to happen to him. It all began with a painful banality. She simply wanted the young man to go away (which it seems he was going to do on his own anyway). Upon finding out that the man had died through his encounter with police she says she was devastated (Olivier 2016). She says now: “I cried. Now when I talk about it, I get really angry” (quoted in Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Upon encountering Gray the Vancouver police officers chase their presumed target across a Boundary Road overpass into Burnaby. Having cornered Gray in a residential yard police deploy the Orwellian named “chemical agents” and then “physical force” supposedly in an effort to restrain him. A short time after the encounter in the yard, and still an apparently short time after police first engaged him Gray was pronounced dead. It is also known that Myles Gray’s injuries were so severe that the funeral home suggested there not be an open casket funeral.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed in BC Supreme Court, Gray was “alone, unarmed, dressed in shorts and not engaged in any criminal activity during his interactions with the seven officers” (quoted in Rankin 2016). He was killed in the secluded backyard of a house in the 8300 block of Joffre Avenue. This was a mere 10 minute walk from where the original complaint had been made to police (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Immediately after Myles Gray was killed his father Mark visited the backyard where his son was killed by police. The yard on Joffre Avenue backs into a steep ravine filled with blackberry bushes (Olivier 2016). The father believes his son was at that point cornered with nowhere to go. This raises further questions about why police could not have engaged him more cautiously and communicatively. Why did they quickly move to force? He could have posed no harm to the general public or bystanders. He could not have gotten away. Mark Gray says that when he visited the yard there were still signs of the struggle. He saw patches of blood, torn up grass, and a destroyed rhododendron bush (Olivier 2016). The thought of what happened is unbearable:</p>
<p>“I can’t get past what happened — I can’t move on. I just feel bad that I wasn’t there to help him. I just wish I was there to help him. I would have in a second died for my son. I still would love to be dead and he still been alive. The thought of him, thinking how he suffered…” (quoted in Olivier 2016)</p>
<p>According to a police news release issued after the killing, one of the few communications from any state authorities in this case, Vancouver police reported that their members responded to a call of a distraught man causing a disturbance. The police account reads in part:</p>
<p>“He [Gary] became agitated and additional officers were called to the scene. Attempts to subdue the man with chemical agents were unsuccessful. A physical altercation ensued, resulting in injuries to the man and six officers. Paramedics were called to attend to the man. He died at the scene.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>None of this, including the timelines involved (when police were sent, when reinforcements were sent or arrived, when chemical agents were applied, what the altercation consisted of) has been confirmed by independent sources. No specific details on any of this have been provided publicly in any way.</p>
<p>Even more the lawsuit suggests interference by police with the investigation by the Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia, the unit charged with investigating cases in which civilians are injured or killed by police. The lawsuit alleges that “the police unlawfully impeded the investigation … by the Independent Investigations Office by failing to immediately notify the IIO of the killing” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Myles Gray’s parents allege that during the delay, “officers failed to preserve evidence” and “conferred among themselves” (quoted in Rankin 2016). These claims are similar to the case of police involved in the killing of Robert Dziekanski in which the officers responsible were found to have colluded in crafting their explanation of what happened (before evidence in a citizen video showed what really occurred). Ironically perhaps it was the inquiry into the Dziekanski killing that led to the formation of the provincial police oversight body in British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds of Silence: The Authorities (Do Not) Respond</p>
<p>Another thing that is known is that for six months authorities have remained silent on the cause or he conditions surrounding Myles Gray’s death. The blue wall of silence remains solidly in place in this case. The Vancouver Police Department only offer this: “It wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for the VPD to comment on an ongoing IIO investigation or a pending civil process” (quoted in Rankin). For its part the BC Coroners Service claims that it cannot comment while the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigates the case. At the same time the IIO, through spokesperson Marten Youssef insists: “Our investigation in this critical incident is ongoing. We are currently waiting on third party reports” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Incredibly, and this is a situation we have discussed previously in some detail, one of the main reasons put forward by the IIO for the ongoing delays in its investigations is the fact that police in British Columbia are harming and killing so many people over the last few years. As Youseff claims:</p>
<p>“The timeliness of our investigations has suffered recently, in large part, as the result of a rash of officer-involved shootings and police-involved fatalities throughout the province that began in September of 2014 and continued for the better part of a year (a total of 20 shootings and fatalities in a period of 12 months).” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>One might ask whether the delays in the face of growing police violence is related to the training hat IIO investigators receive from the Justice Institute of British Columbia, the training academy staffed by and geared toward police officers. One might also ask why provincial resources are not forthcoming given the apparent need to step up investigations of officers through the IIO?</p>
<p>In the face of this terrible situation the Gray family asks for de-escalation training to be improved within the Vancouver Police Department. Their wish is that changes will come, in part through the impetus of their lawsuit, so that their son’s death will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>Gray’s parents knew him as someone who was gentle and walked away from fights. If he was involved in some sort of difficulty on August 13 it was not in character. In fact there is still no evidence that suggests Myles Gray was either in a vulnerable state or suffering from some sort of mental health crisis (apart from any stress caused by being chased and attacked by police of course)a psychotic break. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that he was under the influence of any intoxicants. On the morning he died he was reported to be happy and in normal spirits according to his workers. While granting that something could have upset him later, though there is no evidence for this, the family and colleagues also note that it need not have led to his death: “Maybe he was having an emotional meltdown. He was probably in a vulnerable state. They pursued him for sure. What he needed probably was some compassion” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>And compassion is certainly what Myles Gray did not receive. The list of people in need of compassion who instead encounter police is a growing one in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die</p>
<p>As in numerous other cases in which several police encounter someone who is spatially contained with nowhere to go, and no way to harm bystanders, there are serious questions why police so quickly resort to lethal force. The mindset and practice of the police assert a framework in which the only option is “comply or die.” A purely authoritarian assertion. Recommendations have long been made about better training, including de-escalation training. Others have raised the possibility of mental health or health care professionals responding instead of or along with police.</p>
<p>These are questions that weigh on Mark Gray. He suggests: “They should definitely have better training. If there&#8217;s seven of them, one should have said, ‘Hey, let&#8217;s back off’ and treat this a little differently in how it went down. It could have gone down a lot differently. And Myles could have been alive today” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by Margie Gray. In her words:</p>
<p>“There needs to be a change in the way they deal with people. They need more training in their de-escalation skills. They just need more training, period … no one should have to live through what we’ve been living through. It’s a living hell. I do not want any family to ever have to go through what we’ve been going through.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>She further adds: “Even getting the details are not going to bring my son back. But in going forward, hopefully there is going to be change. This cannot happen to anybody else. Because I feel like if this happened to our family, it can literally happen to anyone’s family” (quoted in Olivier 2016). Given the histories of police killings of civilians in Canada there is little reason for optimism that charges will be laid against any of the officers involved.</p>
<p>And no family should have to go through any of this. In too many cases police are deployed in cases for which they are neither prepared nor equipped. At the same time they interact in those situations, even where the behavior that brought the call is minor, on an absolutist basis pursuing the authoritarian and violent lines that have been ingrained in them (and which are the basis of their operations). With no leeway, or inclination, to soften the approach or act in a more nuanced way. Of course, real care, service, and protection of regular humans in need has never been the purpose or role of police in state capitalist contexts (or any other context for that matter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion: Why Call the Cops Anyway?</p>
<p>From another, more critical, perspective one might question why state authorities are deployed in such circumstances at all. Clearly arguments over lawn care, and civic responsibilities during water shortages, should not result in calls to the state or to the deployment of armed forces. Larger questions remain about sociality and social engagement in anomic, detached, privatized societies. One of the problems with policing is that it breeds reliance or dependence on policing. People do not resolve social differences, even minor ones, through discussion or agreement to disagree, Instead the initial, almost reflexive, response is to call the cops. And unfortunately the cops are all too willing to oblige (it builds public relations and helps maintain or increase budgets after all). So-called “tough on crime” or broken windows approaches I the context of broader socio-political cultures of fear and panic only make things worse.</p>
<p>The sociologist Emile Durkheim suggested that in stratified societies with a broad division of labor, as in advanced capitalist modernity, are subject to conditions of anomie or a breakdown of shared norms, values, and beliefs (the conscience collective). Such societies are marked by a lack of trust among people and a tendency toward dependence on authorities. Under these conditions, and manipulable fear that accompanies them, people turn too readily to authorities and are too accepting of the actions taken by authorities however egregious they might be. Thus police are able to kill and get away with killing while remaining silent or worse obstructionist or disassembling in the face of questions from the loved ones of those whose lives have been taken.</p>
<p>As Mark Gray puts it: “I want my son back, but that’s never going to happen. It could be (that) other people will have their son killed, and it’s just not right the way they treat people. It’s just not right” (quoted in Ranking 2016).</p>

Dicesare, who police believed was armed with an Uzi submachine-gun, called 911 during the incident and stayed on the line with the operator for 32 minutes until the shooting. When he finally came to a stop he pointed the Uzi at the officers, who opened fire. Dicesare was struck by nine bullets. The investigation found no cause to lay charges against the officers.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       <p>A man, identified as Mark Dicesare (24), shot multiple times by Winnipeg police following pursuit by dozens of police vehicles died of multiple injuries inflicted by police on November 6, 2015. His death was announced on November 7.</p>
<p>Winnipeg police have still released few details of the killing but they have confirmed that firearm discharge occurred, involving their officers. Witnesses, including at least one news reporter, have stated that multiple officers opened fire on the man simultaneously during a brief standoff in a field in the city near Lipsett Hall at the former Kapyong Barracks military site.</p>
<p>Several police vehicles had pursued the man to the field after he was reportedly see driving erratically. Witnesses reported around 30 police vehicles involved in the standoff. The shooting occurred about 45 minutes after police first became involved and during a 20 minute standoff.</p>
<p>Local radio station CJOB recorded the observation of one witness identified as Brian who saw police open fire on the man: “The driver &#8230; came out, had his hands in his coat breast pocket, took his hand outside of his jacket, and at least ten to twelve officers just opened fire and blew the heck out of him” (CP 2015).</p>
<p>CBC Winnipeg recorded a lengthy witness account of the killing:</p>
<p>“A white man with black hair, black jacket got out [and] started walking around his vehicle very nervously, had his hand in his jacket pocket, inside his jacket, started to pull his hand out of his jacket. And I&#8217;d have to say 10 to 12 police officers just rapid-fire opened up, and that was it. It was just, &#8216;Bang, bang, bang&#8217; all at the same time. It&#8217;s just like a movie; it&#8217;s just unbelievable. Like, it just wasn&#8217;t one shot. It sounded [like] at least 10, all at the same time.” (CBC 2015)</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which investigates all serious incidents involving police, is investigating the killing. The IIU began operations only a few months ago and has yet to provide a report on any of the numerous police involved shootings in Manitoba.</p>

Officers reportedly responded at 10:20 AM to a report of a man carrying a knife at the parking lot of a Dairy Queen at Norwell Drive and Highway 19A.</p>
<p>Two Nanaimo RCMP members initially arrived at the scene locating the man they believed to be the suspect along nearby Country Club Drive. The man was engaged by officers and during the encounter multiple shots were fired with the man being struck fatally. The victim was taken by ambulance to hospital where he died of injuries inflicted by the officers.</p>
<p>The shooting was reported by neighbors as occurring around 10:40 AM when neighbors near St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church at the corner of Wassell Way and Departure Bay Road first heard what they believed to be gunshots.</p>
<p>Neighbors reported hearing two shots distinctly. A neighbor near the scene of the shooting related: “It’s pretty scary, I’d never heard anything like that.” According to another neighbor: “I saw an ambulance here, firetrucks, like, I thought maybe it was some kind of movie set going on at first and then I realized that was real life” (quoted in Yu 2016). Reported Sonjia Grandahl, a nearby resident: “I just heard some bang, bang and I knew it didn’t sound right” (quoted in Yu 2016). Rob Waine, a member of nearby St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, heard the gunshots while at a meeting inside the church. In his account: “I heard thunder, maybe around 10:30 [AM] and then maybe five or 10 minutes later I hear popping sounds, maybe a couple, that’s about all” (quoted in Yu 2016).</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that investigates cases of police violence against civilians in British Columbia, reported that it had been notified about an officer involved shooting in Nanaimo at around noon. This raises some questions about the timeline of police notification to the IIO about the shooting and about the integrity of the crime scene in the period before IIO were notified and able to reach the scene. Local reporter Karl Yu reported that uniformed and plain clothes RCMP members were all over the area even as the investigation was supposed to start.</p>
<p>This is the second known killing by RCMP in Nanaimo, a small city, in recent years. RCMP shot and killed Jeffery Scott Hughes, 48, on October 23, 2009.</p>

       *<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, has issued its report on the June 14, 2016 police shooting of 49-year-old Craig Andrew Ford and, as per usual exonerates the RCMP officer responsible. The IIO reports that three officers responded to a call of a man walking outside a restaurant carrying a knife in the city’s Norwell Drive area. Notably, the IIO reports that the caller said the man did not appear to be threatening anyone.</p>
<p>The report says one officer first encountered Ford on Country Club Drive, behind St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and he was allegedly  “walking purposefully” (though it is not explained what this meant exactly A second officer then arrived in a car. As Ford began walking towards the vehicle the officer shot Ford twice. There is nothing in the report to suggest how an officer inside a police vehicle was under any threat from a man allegedly holding a knife and nothing more. There is some hint in the report that police were attempting to imply the bogus and discredited &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuse.</p>
<p>Of note, the IIO came to its conclusion despite that fact that the officer who shot Ford declined to provide a statement or his notes. One can ask how any “investigation” has any veracity or legitimacy when it is not mandatory for Mounties under investigation to provide information, not even their notes, or to be questioned. Such is the dubious and limited nature of so-called investigations of police who kill in Canada.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of this the IIO felt confident in declaring: “(The officer) had to act quickly to protect himself, and had little time to weigh his options. It was reasonable for him to shoot in defense.” Again, it is not clear how shooting someone armed with no more than a knife, who is several feet from the officer who is safely inside a police vehicle can be constituted as an act of defense. It is as if the IIO is writing the officer’s own exoneration note.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 25, 2016, a 63-year-old man, identified as André Benjamin, was both tasered and fatally shot by Montréal police in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. The victim was shot by police around 8 AM during a police intervention a few blocks away from the city’s iconic Olympic Stadium. He was taken to hospital where he was declared deceased. According to police reports, the Montréal police were called to an apartment block at Ontario Street and Sicard Street regarding someone in apparent psychological distress. The call was reportedly made by a family member of the victim (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>Poignantly, the police shooting of André Benjamin comes a mere six weeks after a coroner’s report was delivered in the police killing of Alain Magloire, another resident of the city who was killed by police while suffering mental distress. Magloire was shot and killed by police two years ago near the city’s bus station (CBC News 2016). The coroner&#8217;s report did recommend the use of stun guns rather than service firearms by police but also called for more extensive and better training for officers in appropriate dealing with people experiencing mental health issues.</p>
<p>Alain Magloire’s brother, Pierre Magloire, expressed sorrow that another man has been killed by the Montréal police force. He sees training rather than equipment as key. In his words: &#8220;It makes me sad that someone, again, has been shot. It’s like I’m always asking for more [training,]. It’s not because you have a stun gun that everything will go away and everything will be fine&#8221; (quoted in CBC News 2016). The killing of André Benjamin confirms this in the most brutal terms.</p>
<p>As is the situation in Quebec, where there is no independent investigations unit that would examine killings by police of civilians in the province, the case has been turned over to another force, in this case the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), the provincial police force.

Family members of the victims have identified the deceased as Shirley Williams, 77, and son Jôvan Williams, 39. The mother and her son were confronted by police at the mother’s home in the small village of Granisle on Babine Lake.</p>
<p>RCMP reported having been called to a “neighbour dispute involving a handgun” at around 12:30 PM local time on Thursday (quoted in CBC News 2016a). Arriving at the home about 1:22 PM they surrounded the home and report attempting to make contact with the residents. Police report that one person exited the home and sometime thereafter shots were fired at approximately 2:50. A second person then reportedly exited the home with shots being fired once more. Paramedics were reported to be waiting nearby and the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Anne Williams, a teacher and twenty-year resident of Granisle who was friends with Shirley Williams, reported that she saw five police cars at the shooting scene as well as officers with rifles (CBC News 2016b).</p>
<p>Jôvan Williams was a carpenter who had also worked in security with the Lake Babine First Nation. His aunt, June Williams, reported that he had recently left the security guard job with the Lake Babine Nation to live with and help his mother (CBC News 2016b). Mother and son were longtime residents of the village of Granisle. Residents reported seeing the pair often out together around town. Strangely the local director for the regional district, Tom Liversidge, jumped to conclusions publicly about the shooting suggesting a police friendly take. Without explaining further or providing evidence he suggested: “It’s really a shocking thing. I know everybody is very surprised. Nobody expected that this lady or her son were violent” (quoted in CBC News 2016a).</p>
<p>The incident is presently under investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the police oversight agency in British Columbia responsible for investigating instances of civilian harm or death involving police officers. Eight Independent Investigations Office investigators have been sent to the village to carry out the investigation. The sheer volume of such instances in the province over the last few years has contributed to a serious backlog of IIO investigations and growing frustration over the lack of answers in several killings by police over that time span.</p>
<p>A stricken June Williams was left to reflect: “My niece has no more mom and no more brother now. They were decent people, they were not troublemakers” (quoted in CBC News 2016b).</p>

A report from the IIO states that both Shirley and Jôvan shot at police upon their arrival. A gunfight ensued and both members of the Williams family were killed. A loaded rifle and a shotgun were recovered from the scene. The officer who shot and killed the mother and son fired a total of four rounds from their rifle. An IIO Investigation absolved the officer of wrongdoing.;    Shot in confrontation with RCMP.; Coroner's Service yet to announce investigation; TBD; TBD; TBD;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>RCMP in Northern British Columbia shot and killed a mother and her son in an encounter in the early afternoon of Thursday, April 21, 2016. Family members of the victims have identified the deceased as Shirley Williams, 77, and son Jôvan Williams, 39. The mother and her son were confronted by police at the mother’s home in the small village of Granisle on Babine Lake.</p>
<p>RCMP reported having been called to a “neighbour dispute involving a handgun” at around 12:30 PM local time on Thursday (quoted in CBC News 2016a). Arriving at the home about 1:22 PM they surrounded the home and report attempting to make contact with the residents. Police report that one person exited the home and sometime thereafter shots were fired at approximately 2:50. A second person then reportedly exited the home with shots being fired once more. Paramedics were reported to be waiting nearby and the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Anne Williams, a teacher and twenty-year resident of Granisle who was friends with Shirley Williams, reported that she saw five police cars at the shooting scene as well as officers with rifles (CBC News 2016b).</p>
<p>Jôvan Williams was a carpenter who had also worked in security with the Lake Babine First Nation. His aunt, June Williams, reported that he had recently left the security guard job with the Lake Babine Nation to live with and help his mother (CBC News 2016b). Mother and son were longtime residents of the village of Granisle. Residents reported seeing the pair often out together around town. Strangely the local director for the regional district, Tom Liversidge, jumped to conclusions publicly about the shooting suggesting a police friendly take. Without explaining further or providing evidence he suggested: “It’s really a shocking thing. I know everybody is very surprised. Nobody expected that this lady or her son were violent” (quoted in CBC News 2016a).</p>
<p>The incident is presently under investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the police oversight agency in British Columbia responsible for investigating instances of civilian harm or death involving police officers. Eight Independent Investigations Office investigators have been sent to the village to carry out the investigation. The sheer volume of such instances in the province over the last few years has contributed to a serious backlog of IIO investigations and growing frustration over the lack of answers in several killings by police over that time span.</p>
<p>A stricken June Williams was left to reflect: “My niece has no more mom and no more brother now. They were decent people, they were not troublemakers” (quoted in CBC News 2016b).</p>

Michel, armed with a machete, tried to leave through the back door, according to a review by the director of criminal prosecutions. When Michel ignored orders to drop the machete and walked toward the street, police tried hitting him with a vehicle to disarm him. When that failed, an officer fired four shots at Michel, who was later pronounced dead of his wounds at hospital. The prosecution review determined police acted reasonably and no charges were warranted.;    Persons who died IN police custody       <p>Police violence against indigenous people and communities remains the ongoing practice of settler colonialism within the Canadian state context. This includes lethal force. Yet systemic racism and colonialism are rarely addressed in investigations of police violence. Many officers are oblivious to the colonial histories of their own institutions. Many have no understanding of colonialism at all.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 6, 2016, Sandy Tarzan Michel, 25, was shot by police on a small Algonquin reserve in Lac-Simon in Abitibi-Témiscamingue about 500 kilometres northwest of Montréal. Shockingly, reports suggest the young man was first struck by a police cruiser and later shot several times by police. According to provincial police Sgt. Benoit Coutu, officers from the Lac-Simon force were responding to reports of a man allegedly brandishing a knife as he was walking in public (Canadian Press 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly Sandy Tarzan Michel is not the first member of his family to be killed by police. In January 2009 his brother, Johnny Junior Michel Dumont, only 19, was shot and killed by police in Lac-Simon. Strangely police also said that Dumont was holding a knife at the time they killed him.</p>
<p>The community, which has been subjected to police violence, confronted local police and tried to stop the entry of provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec, who were called to assist the local force. Residents apparently blocked the entrance of police vehicles. Three people were arrested by the police at the scene.</p>
<p>SQ spokesperson Sergeant Daniel Thibodeau used these words to describe the situation: &#8220;It&#8217;s a high emotion type of situation that this community is not used to dealing with &#8230; Incidents from the past have carried over so there&#8217;s a bit of a build of tension&#8221; (quoted in Shingler 2016). It is not likely that the “incidents from the past” referred to be Thibodeau include ongoing practices of systemic racism and colonialism.</p>
<p>Unlike in other provinces, including Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, there is no independent unit to investigate incidents in which police officers injure or kill civilians. Instead another police force is asked to investigate in such cases. In response to the killing of Sandy Tarzan Michel, Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux initially tasked provincial police with conducting the investigation into the situation resulting in this killing. This was surprising given that members of the Lac-Simon force had been n communication with provincial police the evening of the killing and had come to the assistance of the local force. The Sûreté du Québec had sent a dozen officers to lend a hand to the local force (CBC News 2016). Responsibility for the investigation was finally moved to the Montréal police force. In any event few would suspect a thorough and critical review into the case by any fellow force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community Not Cops</p>
<p>Provincial police have been given supervision of the territory as the investigations move forward. Incredibly the SQ asked members of the press to stay away from Lac-Simon while they investigate (CBC News 2016). Around 1,200 people live in the town.</p>
<p>The police officers’ association in Lac-Simon has taken advantage of the killings to call for still more policing resources in the area and has blamed what they call a “public security crisis” in the community. Yet community members refer instead to a public health crisis and speak to issues of health, economic inequality, and harm reduction.</p>
<p>Michel’s family has relied on the support and care of people in the small community after having two loved ones taken from them by police in strikingly similar fashion. They report that many have reached out to contact and support the family.</p>
<p>According to Judith Brazeau, the partner of Michel’s father: “We are living with our pain. We help each other a lot. If someone is hurting, there is always someone there” (quoted in Northcott and Laframboise 2016).</p>
<p>In a public show of support for the family and anger at the police violence inflicted on their community, around 100 people marched Friday afternoon, April 8, to protest the circumstances surrounding Michel’s killing by police.</p>

       *<p>On April 6, 2016 Lac-Simon police shot and killed 25-year-old father of three Sandy Tarzan Michel, after first hitting him with a car. On Thursday, June 15, 2017 The Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions for the province announced its decision not to lay charges against the officers responsible. The Lac-Simon force was not investigated by an independent body but  rather by Montreal police who made the recommendation, not surprisingly, not to lay charges.</p>
<p>Four officers had been sent to Michel’s home, in the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon in western Quebec just south of Val-d&#8217;Or, apparently in response to a domestic call. Police claim to have approached Michel on the basis that he was known to them. The police report says Michel exited his house carrying a machete but notes that officers drove into him with their police car. No statement on whether or not this is standard and sanctioned police procedure. Yet the Montreal police did suggest that it was legal activity with which the Director agreed with. When this did not give them the desired result an officer fired four shots and killed the man.</p>
<p>Since this investigation was begun Quebec has established an oversight body the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations). Only two days before the Lac-Simon announcement, critics held a press conference claiming the BEI was neither transparent nor effective.</p>

Jean-Pierre died several days later as a result of his wound. Although an investigation has been completed, details are not yet available because the officer who fired the fatal shot has been charged with manslaughter. The killing sparked a riot in Montreal that left a police station vandalized.       *<p>Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert, who killed Bony Jean-Pierre (46) in April 2016, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge against him. Gilbert shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a plastic bullet during a raid. The killing of Jean-Pierre sparked an uprising in the Montreal North Neighborhood where the shooting happened. The charge against officer Gilbert represents only the ninth time since 1999 that an officer has been charged in the injuring or killing of a civilian in Quebec.</p>
<p>Gilbert was not present in court for the July 6, 2017 appearance.  His defence lawyer Isabelle Briand also informed the court that Gilbert wants a trial by judge and jury. Gilbert’s next court date is scheduled for August 29, 2017.</p>
       *<p>It is among the rarest of occurrences in Canada that a killer cop is ever charged for taking the life of a civilian. Oversight agencies, which are not autonomous or independent of police, prosecutors, and judges work to ensure that the state protects the state and killer cops are legitimized. On Wednesday, May 24, 2017 one of those rare events occurred with the laying of charges against Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert who killed 46-year-old Bony Jean-Pierre on March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Murder charges against police are unheard of and officer Gilbert has been charged with manslaughter. He shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a rubber bullet, a projectile that police routinely use, as in protests for example, and which police propagandists pose as non-lethal.  The charges were announced by Quebec’s Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP). Officer Gilbert was released under a promise to appear on July 6, 2017.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), Quebec’s investigation unit, which now examines incidents of police harm to civilians was not established when the investigation into Jean-Pierre’s killing was initiated. Instead the charges come, incredibly, following an investigation by Quebec provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ).</p>
<p>The Montreal North community, long angered by police targeting and violence organized and mobilized in response to the police killing of Jean-Pierre. At least 100 people participated in a march and rally in June. At that time some cars and banks were vandalized and objects thrown at the police station in a community uprising. The march occurred on what would have been the 26th birthday of Fredy Villanueva, a young man shot and killed by police in 2008 when Montreal policed moved aggressively to break up a game of dice in a park. Yes, he was killed for playing dice. The killing of Fredy Villanueva highlighted the racist targeted policing practices of Montreal police, reinforced by the killing of Bony Jean-Pierre.</p>

Taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Alex Wettlaufer would die of his wounds in the early morning of March 14, 2016.</p>
<p>Police were reportedly responding to reports of two men fighting at the Leslie subway station in the late evening of March 13. How this would lead them to confront and kill Alex Wettlaufer in a park, Villaways Park, blocks away is not readily known.</p>
<p>What is known is that police claims about the confrontation, and the claim that Wettlaufer had a weapon, do not mesh with what family members heard over the phone as the young man plead with police to lower their weapons.</p>
<p>Wettlaufer was speaking with his family by phone moments before he was fatally shot by police. According to his mother, Wendy Wettlaufer: “He was crying, saying that he’s being surrounded. They kept telling him to put the weapon down, and he kept hollering telling them he didn’t have a weapon” (quoted in Wilson 2016)</p>
<p>According to his sister, Melissa Wettlaufer: &#8220;He told them it was just a phone, but they shot him anyway” (quoted in Gillis 2016). His loved ones heard him tell the police he only had a phone and try to get them to put their guns down.</p>
<p>Responding to police claims, the victim’s mother said: “Alex does not carry a gun, he’s never had a weapon, and he (doesn’t) own a weapon” (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>His sister insisted that her brother had a lot to look forward to in life and would not have jeopardized it by challenging police. Not while he was waiting on word of his acceptance into the army, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his late father “Shorty.” In his sister Melissa’s words: “He is not really a fighter and he wouldn’t have turned around and ruined everything because he was going into the army&#8221; (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>People who knew the young man agreed that they knew him as someone who worked hard at school. He was described as being serious in his approach. Alex Wettlaufer’s sister-in-law put it like this: “He was the one no one worried about” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>Wettlaufer’s brother noted that his younger sibling worked in a factory and had never had any run-ins with the law prior to being shot and killed by police. His brother described him as a quiet man who did not even use social media. He believed he had never touched a gun (Campbell 2016). According to his brother, who preferred not to be named: “He kept to himself and was never in trouble” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>A neighbor, Lilieth Rankine, who has known the Wettlaufer family for years, and lives in the same housing complex on Leslie north of Sheppard, remembers the victim fondly. In her view: “He’s a good kid, went to school, finished school. I don’t get it . . . What happened? Can you imagine what the community is going through?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Another family friend Diane Storm similarly remembered Alex Wettlaufer as focused with specific personal goals in life. In her words: “He was quiet, kept to himself … (he wanted) to get out of here, to get out of housing” (quoted in Gillis 2016). Storms suggests, ominously, that the stigma and attention that young men in the community receive from police posed ongoing, real, and potentially fatal barriers, for young residents. She suggests: “When you are trying to improve yourself, it doesn’t help when you have this stigma” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly, Wettlaufer was a classmate and friend of Sammy Yatim, a young man infamously shot and killed by police while he was completely alone and isolated on a Toronto street car. The officer who killed Yatim, James Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder in a curious verdict (“attempted murder” even though he actually killed Yatim) following a rare case of a police officer in Canada actually being brought to trial for killing someone.</p>
<p>The Wettlaufer family reported that their loved one was simply returning home after visiting his girlfriend at the time police confronted and killed him. His brother said he was walking through the park after taking his girlfriend to the subway station.</p>
<p>Family friend Diane Storms was shaken by the killing. She asks: “Can you imagine, talking to your child on the phone, then hearing gunshots? And then silence?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which probes incidents of death, serious injury, and allegations of sexual assault involving police, has been investigating the killing since Monday morning.  Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case.</p>

       *<p>Based on the outcomes of several recent coroners’ inquests and investigations by oversight agencies it appears that the “suicide by cop” excuse is being used to let killer cops off the hook in various jurisdictions in Canada. It is becoming a “go to” justification for killer cops. The numerous problems with this bogus conclusion have been outlined in several reports for this project.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario added to the suicide by cop chorus legitimizing police killings of civilians in the case of the killing of 21-year-old Alex Wettlaufer by Toronto Police on March 13, 2016. Wettlaufer was shot three times while isolated in the Villaways Park in North York after a lengthy standoff in which it seems clear police had multiple opportunities to use non-lethal means and/or have a health care provider attend.</p>
<p>Two 911 calls apparently made by Wettlaufer suggested he needed health care assistance. Yet no health care personnel were dispatched to the scene. Only police. And they waited for the Toronto Police Emergency Task Force (ETF) to arrive. Wettlaufer was said to be holding a cell phone and a BB gun.</p>
<p>The claim of suicide by cop is especially dubious in this case given that on at least one occasion during the interaction with police Wettlaufer tried to get away by fleeing into the woods at Villaways Park. Police pursued him seemingly cornering him. By the SIU’s own account Wettlauufer even put down his BB gun several times. During the standoff the young man was alone on a bridge in the park. It is not clear that he posed any threat to the public at that time. By the SIU account, ETF had taken cover in the woods, being able to see Wettlaufer isolated and alone on the bridge. He was also apparently on his cellphone with 911 and expressing his distress during the standoff. And still no health care providers were deployed. So police, in positions of cover, shoot a distressed youth, on the phone with 911, who is alone on a bridge, and who has repeatedly set his BB gun down. And this is “suicide by cop.” The leap of logic by SIU director Tony Loparco is perplexing. In his conclusion: “ “Given that Mr. Wettlaufer was no doubt aware that he had a mere BB gun in hand, his actions lead me to the conclusion that he was attempting to bait the police into fatally shooting him by creating a perilous situation.” Quite a claim.</p>
<p>The three officers who killed Wettlaufer did not participate in the investigation as is their right under the limited and insufficient oversight rules. The investigation took fourteen months despite the SIU goalpost of 120 days.</p>
<p>As a  result of the SIU report no charges will be laid against the three officers who opened fire on Wettlaufer.</p>

<p>Responding to police claims, the victim’s mother said: “Alex does not carry a gun, he’s never had a weapon, and he (doesn’t) own a weapon” (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>His sister insisted that her brother had a lot to look forward to in life and would not have jeopardized it by challenging police. Not while he was waiting on word of his acceptance into the army, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his late father “Shorty.” In his sister Melissa’s words: “He is not really a fighter and he wouldn’t have turned around and ruined everything because he was going into the army&#8221; (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>People who knew the young man agreed that they knew him as someone who worked hard at school. He was described as being serious in his approach. Alex Wettlaufer’s sister-in-law put it like this: “He was the one no one worried about” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>Wettlaufer’s brother noted that his younger sibling worked in a factory and had never had any run-ins with the law prior to being shot and killed by police. His brother described him as a quiet man who did not even use social media. He believed he had never touched a gun (Campbell 2016). According to his brother, who preferred not to be named: “He kept to himself and was never in trouble” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>A neighbor, Lilieth Rankine, who has known the Wettlaufer family for years, and lives in the same housing complex on Leslie north of Sheppard, remembers the victim fondly. In her view: “He’s a good kid, went to school, finished school. I don’t get it . . . What happened? Can you imagine what the community is going through?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Another family friend Diane Storm similarly remembered Alex Wettlaufer as focused with specific personal goals in life. In her words: “He was quiet, kept to himself … (he wanted) to get out of here, to get out of housing” (quoted in Gillis 2016). Storms suggests, ominously, that the stigma and attention that young men in the community receive from police posed ongoing, real, and potentially fatal barriers, for young residents. She suggests: “When you are trying to improve yourself, it doesn’t help when you have this stigma” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly, Wettlaufer was a classmate and friend of Sammy Yatim, a young man infamously shot and killed by police while he was completely alone and isolated on a Toronto street car. The officer who killed Yatim, James Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder in a curious verdict (“attempted murder” even though he actually killed Yatim) following a rare case of a police officer in Canada actually being brought to trial for killing someone.</p>
<p>The Wettlaufer family reported that their loved one was simply returning home after visiting his girlfriend at the time police confronted and killed him. His brother said he was walking through the park after taking his girlfriend to the subway station.</p>
<p>Family friend Diane Storms was shaken by the killing. She asks: “Can you imagine, talking to your child on the phone, then hearing gunshots? And then silence?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which probes incidents of death, serious injury, and allegations of sexual assault involving police, has been investigating the killing since Monday morning.  Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case.</p>

Police confronted LaFleur in a cab and when he raised a gun, three officers opened fire. The gun he was holding was found to be an inoperable pellet gun. Friends and family described Devon as a gentle person who had struggled with mental illness since youth, according to news reports. The officers were cleared in the incident.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>Police in Canada have an alarming and dubious record of killing people who are apparently struggling with mental health issues. Late in the evening of Friday, March 4, 2016 the Toronto police, among the forces most notorious for executing people with mental illness, killed again. The victim, not identified by police, has been identified by family as Devon LaFleur, an Ottawa resident said to be struggling with mental health issues. According to family, who reported LaFleur missing on Friday, he had been suffering with bipolar disorder. The young man was shot multiple times and killed in front of a women’s shelter where he had gone to visit a friend after travelling to Toronto.</p>
<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), Ontario&#8217;s police watchdog, officers shot the 30-year-old man in front of a building on Bayview Avenue, south of Steeles Avenue East, in North York around 10 PM Friday evening. The victim was taken to Sunnybrook Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>According to SIU spokesman Jason Gennaro a dozen officers were on the scene at the time LaFleur was shot and killed. According to the SIU three officers fired shots at the victim resulting in his death.</p>
<p>LaFleur’s aunt, Janet Page Andersen described her nephew as having a “lifetime of trouble” and said he did not like taking his medication because it left him feeling “dumbed down” (a rather common concern people experience) (quoted in Doucette 2016). Andersen also described LaFleur as a “sensitive, joyful person” who was loved by many people, despite the struggles he endured (quoted in Doucette, 2016). She reflected on her nephew in these terms: “He’s a sensitive, joyful person and who loved nature and trusted people” (quoted in Laucius 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly emblematic of his caring nature, LaFleur may have been killed while trying to help a friend. According to Andersen, the family believes Devon LaFleur travelled to Toronto in the first place because he wanted to comfort a female friend who was staying in a women’s shelter (Laucius 2016).</p>
<p>Malcolm LaFleur, traveled to Toronto and spent Saturday scouring the area where police killed his son in a desperate effort to find out information about the lethal confrontation that left his son dead. According to Andersen: “My brother is devastated. Police aren’t telling him anything” (quoted in Doucette 2016).</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports by police suggested that LaFleur had earlier robbed a bank in Ottawa. His father had told police that he had no weapon but an air gun and made clear it was not a real firearm. According to Andersen: “He has had a hard time of it. But he had an air gun. He was not a dangerous man” (quoted in Doucette 2016).</p>
<p>A lover of nature and the outdoors, LaFleur had recently visited the West Coast and was looking to move to Vancouver Island with his father. Images he posted online showed photos of seals, seabirds, and himself hugging a massive tree. On his Facebook page he described himself as a “lost boy” (Doucette 2016).</p>

       *<p>Devon LaFleur, a young man struggling with mental health issues, was killed by Toronto police who had been informed of his mental illness and of the fact that the “weapon” he held was a broken pellet gun that did not work. His family had shared that information with Ottawa police who contacted Toronto police about the young man. Still police rained down at least 21 bullets on him striking him eight times. On June 6, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) ruled, incredibly, that despite this Toronto police were “more than justified” in killing LaFleur. <em>More than justified</em>.</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s mother, attributes the killing of her son to a failure of communication by police and inadequate, improper, or insufficient training of police in interacting with people experiencing mental health issues. LaFleur had schizophrenia and was apparently not on his medication the night police killed him.</p>
<p>According to Rena LaFleur, police disregarded the information they had, instead choosing to take a typically aggressive and confrontational approach with the young man. In her words:</p>
<p>“They created a situation in which they were confronting [him]. I can’t see how they can possibly justify that that is a viable mental health protocol. It&#8217;s shameful. I find it&#8217;s just a shame and many more people are going to die, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur reveals that she had spoken with police about her son’s situation and there was a plan to have plainclothes Toronto officers attend the home of a friend with whom Devon LaFleur was meeting. She suggests: “They had a lot of time. They had what seemed to be a good plan in place and they changed it at the last minute” (quoted in 2017). She does not know why.</p>
<p>What did happen is that four uniformed police officers arrived at the friend’s house in marked cruisers. Officers yelled at the distressed man throughout the encounter and drew their guns on him. According to the SIU one officer fired 12 to 13 shots, the second fired eight to nine shots, while the third fired one bullet.</p>
<p>Sascha LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s sister suggests: “So how do you say [we’ll shoot] to somebody who’s in psychosis, that believes that the angels will protect him from the bullets. You’re provoking him. There needs to be other methods of de-escalation, not lethal force, because you can’t come back from that” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>As Rena LaFleur puts it, painfully directly: “He didn’t have to die” (quoted in 2017).</p>

According to an independent investigation, when police arrived at David William McQueen's home they found bullet holes in a front window. During a 90-minute standoff the paraplegic who struggled with mental illness fired a gun through the windows, roof and walls of his home. When a tactical team moved in McQueen emerged from the backdoor in a wheelchair holding a gun and fired two rounds. Police returned fire, striking McQueen in the head.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>The Calgary man shot and killed by in the city’s Huntington Hills neighborhood was 53-year-old David McQueen, a quadriplegic. McQueen was killed by Calgary police on Sunday, January 24, 2016, after what was reported as an hours long standoff. More than a dozen officers, including tactical team members, responded to the situation in the northwest neighborhood at around 4:40 PM. McQueen had experienced years of neglect, marginalization, and lack of support from various levels of government and the health care systems following a spinal injury suffered in an accident that left him quadriplegic in 1994. The victim had actively sought to improve his life situation and actively sought support from government and social service and health care agencies, with repeated lack of proper assistance over decades. Police shot McQueen immediately as the man exited his home in his wheelchair. Police said he had a handgun which had been fired in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>There was at least one person who was familiar with and cared about David McQueen’s situation. Unfortunately she was barred by police from speaking with him in the moments before he was killed by police. McQueen’s longtime caregiver, Isabelle Templeton, was talking over the phone with McQueen even as police surrounded his house. Templeton went to the scene and tried to talk with McQueen directly but was prevented by police. She heard the shots that killed McQueen while she was there on the street. In her words: &#8220;We heard the shots fired. We heard when we were sitting out on the street talking to the police officer. We didn&#8217;t know what was happening, but we knew something was going on&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton related to reporters that McQueen used to call her his &#8220;Calgary mom.&#8221; She affirmed that the victim was a &#8220;very gentle and very caring man&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). Templeton had no guess as to what, if anything, might have finally pushed McQueen over the line into more public expression of frustration. In her recollection: &#8220;Nothing like this ever came up. I just don&#8217;t know what triggered it&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). At the same time she did acknowledge that McQueen had experienced a great deal of suffering with little to no support from public officials or the health care system. In her view: &#8220;Something did [break], but I think a lot of it was pain. Just pain. He was in so much pain&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). In the end, “He just got kind of desperate” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton acknowledged that McQueen was particularly frustrated with the healthcare system and the government, with apparent justification. She noted that he was stuck in a broken wheelchair and left alone without proper homecare. She also confirmed that McQueen was angry and distrustful of police based on the character of their interactions with him. Again she concluded: &#8220;I think he just got kind of desperate. I don&#8217;t know. I know I was getting desperate, just going to see him, and there was nothing you could do&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen had appeared in a video for Easter Seals as part of one of the agency’s campaigns. He appears in the video along with his beloved dog, his main companion. A spokesperson with Easter Seals Calgary, Stephanie Rosch, acknowledged that she knew of McQueen and confirmed that the video was filmed as part of a public-service announcement in 2009 (CBC 2016). Easter Seals Alberta CEO, Susan Boivin released a brief statement: &#8220;We are very saddened to hear the news of the passing of Dave McQueen. He was a former client of Easter Seals&#8217; Equipment and Support Services program, but we have not had any contact with him for many years&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen&#8217;s had long documented the lack of support and what he experienced as mistreatment on behalf of the federal and provincial governments, and the healthcare system. His Facebook page contains numerous, lengthy posts detailing his experiences of injustice. McQueen describes how he suffered a spinal injury after diving into Calgary&#8217;s Sikome Lake in 1994, not realizing how shallow the man-made body of water actually is. He outlines his subsequent, unsuccessful attempts to sue the Alberta government over his injury (CBC 2016). Far from receiving support, several of McQueen&#8217;s publicly available Facebook postings suggest that he had come to believe that his computer and phone were being monitored by the authorities. McQueen posted that police had targeted him in the past and he expressed anger at how he had been treated by them.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Party leader David Swann released a statement in response to the killing reporting that McQueen had &#8220;reached out frequently&#8221; to his constituency office. He noted that McQueen was always polite. Swann suggested that McQueen’s story was one example of the numerous cases of people falling through the cracks in Alberta. Yet he does not seem to recognize his own possible role in that given the fact that McQueen had contacted his office frequently looking for assistance. Swann did say in his statement on McQueen: &#8220;He was suffering from an obvious, and serious, mental illness and it was often difficult to understand where he was coming from or how we could help.&#8221; According to Swann this is another example, if an extreme and violent one, of the great need for changes to the system. Wrote Swann: &#8220;David was also angry. Angry with the injury which all but paralyzed him, angry with a system he felt failed him, and angry with those who represented that system.&#8221; That includes police whom he felt had targeted and mistreated rather than helping him. This in a health care context requiring supportive rather than police services in the first place. Swann’s statement concluded: “My thoughts are also with those, like my staff, who interacted with Mr. McQueen and are left, today, feeling they could have done more.&#8221;</p>
<p>On January 15 McQueen posted that his main companion, his dog had died. The post goes on to outline his anger over Calgary police and a Calgary politician, as well as his neighbours who may have been responsible for police interactions with him. Templeton notes that the death of his dog was devastating because it increased his loneliness and lack of companionship. Incredibly, Templeton suggested that healthcare workers would not visit McQueen because of his dog.</p>
<p>The police killing of David McQueen must be contextualized within the apparently growing trend in Canada of police involved killings of people experiencing mental health crises or distress. While statistics have not been kept in a systematic or reliable manner in Canada, between 2004 and 2014, the percentage of those cases of police killings of civilians involving people in mental crisis grew: they now account for about 40 percent of civilian shooting deaths at the hands of police (Firsthand 2016). Researchers for the documentary film Hold Your Fire report that in 2014, Toronto police answered 20,000 interactions involving people in mental crisis while Vancouver police say they respond to nearly 30,000 calls each year involving people experiencing mental illness (Firsthand 2016).</p>
<p>Reasons for the apparent growth in police involved interactions, and lethal interactions, with people in mental health crisis are numerous and include economic crisis which spurs emotional crisis for more people; lack of proper and adequate community health services (and government cuts to services in the context of austerity regimes that target programs of need to the working class and poor for reduction or elimination), and; law and order and broken windows policing regimes that send police first to deal with any social disturbance. Even more, commentators like the producers of Hold Your Fire suggest that the real reason for more lethal actions undertaken by police in addressing people dealing with metal health crisis (and often police kill people upon first sight of the victim, often within one or two minutes of encounter) is improper, inadequate, outmoded, and regressive police training. This more than anything else (Firsthand 2016). We might suggest, however, that this is built into the very structure of the police as an institution of violence, repression, domination, and control.</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) is investigating as is policy in Alberta when police are involved in incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities to civilians. Yet there is reason for concern about the investigation given statements made by Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin following McQueen’s killing by police. Chaffin said he expects the shooter&#8217;s motivation to be addressed as part of the investigation. The chief also, not surprisingly, stood by the actions of the officers responding to the incident despite the fact that no investigation has been conducted or completed. And despite the fact that the victim was quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Chief Chaffin also reported that McQueen was known to police but did not suggest that this was related to any wrongdoing on behalf of the victim. Indeed he had to admit that none of the visits to McQueen’s home involved anything of a criminal nature. Such statements about victims being known to police is a common tactic used by police in Canada to cast aspersions toward victims and to damage their reputation publicly, or suggest without evidence that they have a criminal history and are, therefore, less deserving of public sympathy. Often victims are known to police only because of a dubious stop by police without cause, as in cases of “carding,” or because the victim actually called police for some type of support or assistance. In fact a search of court documents by reporters found that McQueen had no criminal record in Alberta. According to Chief Chaffin the Calgary Police Department is and was concerned with the well-being of their officers first and above all else.</p>

       *<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the unit that investigates police harm to civilians, has cleared the repeat killer cop and the other Calgary police officers who shot and killed David McQueen, a 53-year-old quadriplegic man in a wheelchair, on January 24, 2016. ASIRT reported that several officers opened fire on McQueen with the last round fired , a bullet from a sniper, striking him in the head and killing him, but said the officers involved were fully justified in the killing. Police had reportedly responded to reports of McQueen firing a round from inside his house. Police fired tear gas into McQueen’s house driving him outside where they shot and killed him.</p>
<p>The killing of McQueen, quadriplegic with limited use of hands, in a wheelchair in his home, experiencing some mental distress has raised many disturbing questions. One of these relates to the fact that a officer who shot at McQueen was a killer cop who had committed a fatal shooting only a year before. That officer shot 27-year-old Anthony Heffernan four times, with three shots to the head and neck, on March 16, 2015. Heffernan had also been in some distress but was alone and confined to his hotel room and posed no threat to anyone, police or public, when police broke into his room and shot and killed him there.</p>
<p>The ASIRT investigation into Heffernan’s killing actually found evidence that an offense had been committed by police. The Crown claimed that there was not enough evidence to gain a conviction against the officer and did not pursue charges. The state certainly protects the state. The Heffernan family is suing Calgary police over the killing of their loved one.</p>
<p>In the ASIRT release on the McQueen killing, Susan Hughson, executive director of ASIRT, suggested that the killer cop’s involvement in the Heffernan case has no bearing on his right to use his firearm in another case. According to Hughson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have to look at the incidents independently and look at the circumstances surrounding them to determine whether the steps taken or the actions taken were justified. And, just because the officer has been involved in another officer-involved shooting, he does not lose the protection of the law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection to kill civilians? Others might ask why the officer was still on the force and being deployed in such situations of a person in distress.</p>
<p>Director Hughson, noted McQueen’s distress: “There’s no doubt that this man was in crisis on this date.” Hughson noted that McQueen had been “struggling physically, emotionally and financially” in the days prior to his being killed by police. He has been particularly upset by the death of his beloved dog only the week before. Disturbingly ASIRT appeared to use this fact to make reference to a bogus “suicide by cop” defense for the police killing of David McQueen.</p>

       *<p>In the Canadian state context there are few legal outcomes as rare as a police officer being convicted for killing a civilian. It is rare enough that an officer who kills someone is even charged for the taking of someone’s life. This is true even in those provinces that have separate investigations units that look into killings by police rather than simply turning a case over to another police force to “investigate.” Indeed as the recent decision by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) not to bring charges in the police killing of Andrew Loku and ongoing criticisms of the backlogged Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia show, these agencies remain limited, and often impede by or too close to, police departments involved in killings. The Loku killing in particular has led to community mobilizations by Black Lives Matter Toronto and allies.</p>
<p>Still it is safe to assume that most residents of provinces that have a dedicated unit that investigates police killings of civilians, like Alberta, would expect that any officer involved in killing a civilian would, at the very least, be taken off of active street duty while under investigation or before any conclusions are released to the public. If an officer may have acted inappropriately, unduly, disgracefully it would only make sense that they would not be released upon the public until review of the officer, their outlook, and conduct was completed and some assessment made. Surely a killer cop would not be turned out on the streets to kill again.</p>
<p>Well, incredibly, stunningly, it seems that just such a situation has been allowed to happen in Alberta with, perhaps predictably, lethal consequences. On January 25, 2016 David McQueen, a quadriplegic, was shot by three Calgary police officers while in his wheelchair inside the doorway to his house. In March 2016 it was revealed that one of the officers who shot McQueen was, at the very moment he fired his weapon, under investigation by the province’s investigation unit ASIRT (Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) for killing another man a year earlier. And he had not been cleared of wrongdoing in the previous killing.</p>
<p>Less than a year before, on March 16, 2015, the officer who would be involved in McQueen’s killing, had shot Anthony Heffernan four times, three times in the head, while the young man was alone and in some distress, but defenseless, in a hotel room. In fact police broke down the door to forcibly enter Heffernan’s room in a Hotel 8 before shooting him.</p>
<p>Said Grant Heffernan, Anthony’s brother, upon hearing the news that the very cop who killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;I am more than outraged that this happened to somebody else in Calgary” (quoted in Grant 2016). The family had been told by ASIRT that as of November 2015 the officer had not returned to work but was actively trying to get back on the job (Grant 2016). Heffernan suggests that family could have dealt with the officer being placed on administrative duty, though they by no means saw this as ideal in the circumstances (Grant 2016). They were shocked that he had been returned to the streets. As Grant Heffernan said upon hearing that the same officer that killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;This is unfathomable that this happened and is totally unacceptable&#8221; (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>The Heffernan family lawyer echoed those sentiments. Tom Engel, commenting on the return of the officer to street duty ahead of being cleared by ASIRT and the Alberta Crown prosecutor:  &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s shocking. You have to respect the presumption of innocence. I don&#8217;t think that you should necessarily suspend the officer from all police duties, but you certainly would take him off the street so that he wouldn&#8217;t be in a position to do that again&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>
<p>There are many questions to be answered in trying to figure out how a young man missing his check-out time could escalate so quickly to his being shot and killed by police. When he had no weapon and no capacity to harm the public (being isolated in a hotel room by himself).</p>
<p>There are also significant questions about how and why an officer under review for a killing of a civilian could be out on the streets to kill again. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, he or she is placed on a minimum 30 day administrative leave. At the end of that period, an evaluation is supposed to be undertaken to determine whether the officer can return to active duty and whether restrictions, and what type of restrictions, will be placed on them following their return. In this case it is not yet clear why the officer was allowed to return to the streets and what, if any, restrictions governed their activity.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 17, 2016, the Heffernan family reported that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has finally told them that it has recommended murder charges. The decision to lay charges rests with the Crown prosecutors. In Grant Heffernan’s words: &#8220;ASIRT is pressing hard,&#8221; (Stark 2016). This is, of course, welcome news. Charges are, as we have noted, rarely laid against officers who kill civilians, even in instances where the case would appear straightforwardly to demand charges be brought.</p>
<p>The news from ASIRT has brought some comfort to the family. Grant Heffernan suggests it is helping their recovery: &#8220;I feel a little better about it. We were very skeptical about ASIRT and any officer being charged&#8221; (quoted in Stark 2016). The family will not know until May 1 whether the Crown will, in fact, follow through and lay charges against the officer.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the police have not responded formally to this news they did offer a rather arrogant, and perhaps knowingly confident, expression of their awareness that no homicide charges have ever been laid against a Calgary police officer (Stark 2016). Such has been too consistent practice in Canada when police brutalize or kill civilians.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family has filed a complaint under the Police Act. That case can go before the law enforcement review board even if charges are not formally laid against the officer (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>For Grant Heffernan there is only one appropriate outcome. That is to ensure that the cop cannot kill a third time. In his words: &#8220;The only way there is going to be any accountability and justice, is if the subject officer who killed my brother &#8230; faces criminal prosecution&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>

       *<p>On Sunday, January 24, 2016, David McQueen, quadriplegic and wheel-chair bound, was shot and killed by Calgary police. In the days following the shooting family and friends remembered and mourned the loss of a dedicated dad and friend with a great sense of humor who dealt with sever health problems, often alone and abandoned by public health services.</p>
<p>Days after McQueen’s killing by Calgary police, one of his two sons, Justin McQueen, remembered his father as a dedicated and loving father. He also noted that his dad had been suffering from extreme loneliness in the period preceding his being shot by police. Justin McQueen was three when his father suffered the spinal injury that left him quadriplegic.</p>
<p>Justin McQueen recalled his dad: &#8220;He was an awesome dad. He didn&#8217;t act as though he had the accident. He played sports, he took us fishing” (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>According to the son the health issues and effects of the injury eroded his father’s well-being over time. The situation degraded as his frustrations with unresponsive or underresponsive governements and public health care systems grew. Justin McQueen notes that his father was never provided with proper home care and his expressions of depression were ignored and untreated (Wiebe 2016). Justin McQueen recalls: &#8220;He was suffering. He was pretty much left in that house and screaming for help and nobody would help him&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>Among McQueen’s closest friends was former NHL gaolie and longtime hockey broadcaster Kelly Hrudey. Hrudey sought out McQueen after reading a story about the Calgary father who was selling flowers from a cart to support his children after being paralyzed in a diving accident at Sikome Lake in 1994. McQueen’s son, Justin, remembers Hrudey helping his family, recalling: “Kelly was my dad’s best friend” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>Hrudey remembers going to meet McQueen after reading his story: “I went down there to visit anonymously. I didn’t tell him who I am or what I do or anything. I just sat there and chatted with him. He had a great sense of humour, he loved to laugh, he was engaging” (quoted in Ho 2016). From there an ongoing friendship developed. The two often got together to chat over lunch.</p>
<p>McQueen’s existing frustrations with government, healthcare services, and police intensified following the death of his beloved companion and service dog, Bear, earlier this month. This left McQueen feeling abandoned and alone according to those who knew him. Recalled Justin McQueen: &#8220;It was his absolute best friend. It was his only best friend&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news that McQueen had been shot and killed by police, Hrudey reflected on his friend’s suffering and the need for access for mental health supports: “It’s terrible. He was everything you wanted in a friend. Unfortunately, and we’ve seen it with a lot of people with mental health issues, it can be completely debilitating. That’s why we need to talk and find the help everybody needs” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>Hrudey, whose daughter has dealt with mental health struggles, spoke of the need for social openness in addressing mental health: “I just know that when Dave was well and functioning in society, he was just so proud of what he was accomplishing. Those were the good days. It’s important we talk about mental health because Dave was more than what happened” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>As is becoming all too frequent in the Canadian context, people struggling with mental health issues are subjected to often lethal intervention from police. Rather than supportive public health services, which are slow to come if at all, the response of police is quick and brutal. Of course an agency designed and organized for compliance and control, to putting down public signs of difference, are not at all suited to addressing mental health needs.</p>

       *<p>The Calgary man shot and killed by in the city’s Huntington Hills neighborhood was 53-year-old David McQueen, a quadriplegic. McQueen was killed by Calgary police on Sunday, January 24, 2016, after what was reported as an hours long standoff. More than a dozen officers, including tactical team members, responded to the situation in the northwest neighborhood at around 4:40 PM. McQueen had experienced years of neglect, marginalization, and lack of support from various levels of government and the health care systems following a spinal injury suffered in an accident that left him quadriplegic in 1994. The victim had actively sought to improve his life situation and actively sought support from government and social service and health care agencies, with repeated lack of proper assistance over decades. Police shot McQueen immediately as the man exited his home in his wheelchair. Police said he had a handgun which had been fired in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>There was at least one person who was familiar with and cared about David McQueen’s situation. Unfortunately she was barred by police from speaking with him in the moments before he was killed by police. McQueen’s longtime caregiver, Isabelle Templeton, was talking over the phone with McQueen even as police surrounded his house. Templeton went to the scene and tried to talk with McQueen directly but was prevented by police. She heard the shots that killed McQueen while she was there on the street. In her words: &#8220;We heard the shots fired. We heard when we were sitting out on the street talking to the police officer. We didn&#8217;t know what was happening, but we knew something was going on&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton related to reporters that McQueen used to call her his &#8220;Calgary mom.&#8221; She affirmed that the victim was a &#8220;very gentle and very caring man&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). Templeton had no guess as to what, if anything, might have finally pushed McQueen over the line into more public expression of frustration. In her recollection: &#8220;Nothing like this ever came up. I just don&#8217;t know what triggered it&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). At the same time she did acknowledge that McQueen had experienced a great deal of suffering with little to no support from public officials or the health care system. In her view: &#8220;Something did [break], but I think a lot of it was pain. Just pain. He was in so much pain&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). In the end, “He just got kind of desperate” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton acknowledged that McQueen was particularly frustrated with the healthcare system and the government, with apparent justification. She noted that he was stuck in a broken wheelchair and left alone without proper homecare. She also confirmed that McQueen was angry and distrustful of police based on the character of their interactions with him. Again she concluded: &#8220;I think he just got kind of desperate. I don&#8217;t know. I know I was getting desperate, just going to see him, and there was nothing you could do&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen had appeared in a video for Easter Seals as part of one of the agency’s campaigns. He appears in the video along with his beloved dog, his main companion. A spokesperson with Easter Seals Calgary, Stephanie Rosch, acknowledged that she knew of McQueen and confirmed that the video was filmed as part of a public-service announcement in 2009 (CBC 2016). Easter Seals Alberta CEO, Susan Boivin released a brief statement: &#8220;We are very saddened to hear the news of the passing of Dave McQueen. He was a former client of Easter Seals&#8217; Equipment and Support Services program, but we have not had any contact with him for many years&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen&#8217;s had long documented the lack of support and what he experienced as mistreatment on behalf of the federal and provincial governments, and the healthcare system. His Facebook page contains numerous, lengthy posts detailing his experiences of injustice. McQueen describes how he suffered a spinal injury after diving into Calgary&#8217;s Sikome Lake in 1994, not realizing how shallow the man-made body of water actually is. He outlines his subsequent, unsuccessful attempts to sue the Alberta government over his injury (CBC 2016). Far from receiving support, several of McQueen&#8217;s publicly available Facebook postings suggest that he had come to believe that his computer and phone were being monitored by the authorities. McQueen posted that police had targeted him in the past and he expressed anger at how he had been treated by them.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Party leader David Swann released a statement in response to the killing reporting that McQueen had &#8220;reached out frequently&#8221; to his constituency office. He noted that McQueen was always polite. Swann suggested that McQueen’s story was one example of the numerous cases of people falling through the cracks in Alberta. Yet he does not seem to recognize his own possible role in that given the fact that McQueen had contacted his office frequently looking for assistance. Swann did say in his statement on McQueen: &#8220;He was suffering from an obvious, and serious, mental illness and it was often difficult to understand where he was coming from or how we could help.&#8221; According to Swann this is another example, if an extreme and violent one, of the great need for changes to the system. Wrote Swann: &#8220;David was also angry. Angry with the injury which all but paralyzed him, angry with a system he felt failed him, and angry with those who represented that system.&#8221; That includes police whom he felt had targeted and mistreated rather than helping him. This in a health care context requiring supportive rather than police services in the first place. Swann’s statement concluded: “My thoughts are also with those, like my staff, who interacted with Mr. McQueen and are left, today, feeling they could have done more.&#8221;</p>
<p>On January 15 McQueen posted that his main companion, his dog had died. The post goes on to outline his anger over Calgary police and a Calgary politician, as well as his neighbours who may have been responsible for police interactions with him. Templeton notes that the death of his dog was devastating because it increased his loneliness and lack of companionship. Incredibly, Templeton suggested that healthcare workers would not visit McQueen because of his dog.</p>
<p>The police killing of David McQueen must be contextualized within the apparently growing trend in Canada of police involved killings of people experiencing mental health crises or distress. While statistics have not been kept in a systematic or reliable manner in Canada, between 2004 and 2014, the percentage of those cases of police killings of civilians involving people in mental crisis grew: they now account for about 40 percent of civilian shooting deaths at the hands of police (Firsthand 2016). Researchers for the documentary film Hold Your Fire report that in 2014, Toronto police answered 20,000 interactions involving people in mental crisis while Vancouver police say they respond to nearly 30,000 calls each year involving people experiencing mental illness (Firsthand 2016).</p>
<p>Reasons for the apparent growth in police involved interactions, and lethal interactions, with people in mental health crisis are numerous and include economic crisis which spurs emotional crisis for more people; lack of proper and adequate community health services (and government cuts to services in the context of austerity regimes that target programs of need to the working class and poor for reduction or elimination), and; law and order and broken windows policing regimes that send police first to deal with any social disturbance. Even more, commentators like the producers of Hold Your Fire suggest that the real reason for more lethal actions undertaken by police in addressing people dealing with metal health crisis (and often police kill people upon first sight of the victim, often within one or two minutes of encounter) is improper, inadequate, outmoded, and regressive police training. This more than anything else (Firsthand 2016). We might suggest, however, that this is built into the very structure of the police as an institution of violence, repression, domination, and control.</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) is investigating as is policy in Alberta when police are involved in incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities to civilians. Yet there is reason for concern about the investigation given statements made by Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin following McQueen’s killing by police. Chaffin said he expects the shooter&#8217;s motivation to be addressed as part of the investigation. The chief also, not surprisingly, stood by the actions of the officers responding to the incident despite the fact that no investigation has been conducted or completed. And despite the fact that the victim was quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Chief Chaffin also reported that McQueen was known to police but did not suggest that this was related to any wrongdoing on behalf of the victim. Indeed he had to admit that none of the visits to McQueen’s home involved anything of a criminal nature. Such statements about victims being known to police is a common tactic used by police in Canada to cast aspersions toward victims and to damage their reputation publicly, or suggest without evidence that they have a criminal history and are, therefore, less deserving of public sympathy. Often victims are known to police only because of a dubious stop by police without cause, as in cases of “carding,” or because the victim actually called police for some type of support or assistance. In fact a search of court documents by reporters found that McQueen had no criminal record in Alberta. According to Chief Chaffin the Calgary Police Department is and was concerned with the well-being of their officers first and above all else.</p>

According to an independent investigation, police found Craig Vincent McDougall outside the home with a cellphone to his ear and a knife in his hand. Police attempted to use a stun gun, but it was ineffective. When he raised the knife police opened fire. An inquest found the shooting justified, and that there was no evidence of systemic racism in the moments leading to the Indigenous man's death.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       *<p>Racism and policing have gone hand and hand in the Canadian context. From the settler colonial violence of the RCMP through contemporary practices from carding to assaults upon racialized people and communities. The settler colonial character of the Canadian state continues in the current context in the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of Indigenous people and the exertion of violence, often lethal violence, against them.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the Canadian state and the various institutions of criminal justice have stridently denied claims of racism. Inquiries into police violence typically offer findings that diminish or deny the part of racism in police actions. Such an outcome was delivered again on May 12, 2017 with the results of the inquiry into the killing of Craig McDougall, a young Indigenous man, by Winnipeg police, a force with a long and notorious history of racist violence.</p>
<p>Twenty-six-year-old Craig Vincent McDougall was shot and killed by police outside his father’s home on Simcoe Street in Winnipeg on August 2, 2008. Police claimed to be responding to a 911 call when they arrived at the home in the early hours of August 2.  They suggest that found McDougall outside the house holding a cell phone and a knife. One officer shot him with a taser. He was then shot with a firearm which killed him. A private investigator who examined the case has cast doubt on the assertion that Craig McDougall held a knife at the moment he was shot.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the victim’s family members were immediately arrested and put in handcuffs on the front lawn, an act of what criminologists term the dramatization of evil, designed to denigrate and humiliate people targeted by the system. Jonathan Rudin, an expert witness on Indigenous people, policing, and the criminal justice system, testified that the treatment of McDougall’s family after the young man was shot exemplified systemic racism as the victims were assumed by police to be criminals and were treated as such.</p>
<p>Still, despite the actions of police, the inquest concluded that there was no evidence of racism in the police actions. It offered the typical statist finding that police were justified in their actions. In the inquest report, Associate Chief Judge Anne Krahn wrote there was “no evidence of racism direct or systemic in the moments leading to the shooting of Craig McDougall.” The judge found the arrest of McDougall’s father and uncle to be a simple misstep. In her words: &#8220;there were missteps in the immediate aftermath of the shooting when Craig McDougall’s uncle and father were left handcuffed and detained without lawful authority.&#8221; Such is the normalization of racism in the Canadian criminal justice system. Atrocious actions become mere missteps.</p>
<p>Critics point out that treating the family members in such disrespectful and accusatory fashion exemplifies racism. One might add the little regard shown for the family or the community in the eight year delay between the killing and the inquest report. It could be suggested that such an egregious delay would never be accepted in the case of a killing (by anyone) of a white, privileged victim. Of course police, and police associations, seek to delay and divert inquests to benefit their own interests.</p>
<p>The inquest report even contradicts its own conclusions by making recommendations that imply racism by police. Among these recommendations are that the police service should consider delivery of implicit bias training for its members at regular intervals (a recognition of racist assumptions) and work with Indigenous organizations to develop programs.</p>

For ramming Campbell's vehicle, the officer was found guilty of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and received three years probation. He was found not guilty of manslaughter in connection to the shooting.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       *<p>It is among the rarest of occurrences for a police officer who kills someone, even under the most dubious of circumstances, to be charged with anything related to the killing. As documented at this site are virtually never charged, and more a range of administrative mechanisms (inquests, inquiries, oversight bodies, etc.) are mobilized to legitimize the cops’ deadly actions. So it is of some note when a killer cop is actually charged, even if the courts often dismiss the charges or find for the killers.</p>
<p>Manitoba RCMP Constable Abram Letkeman has been charged with manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death, reckless discharge of a firearm, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and dangerous driving causing bodily harm is the shooting and killing of Steven Campbell (39), a father of two, in Thompson, Manitoba in 2015. Constable Letkeman was arrested March 1, 2017. Letkeman shot and killed Campbell following a police chase on November 21, 2015. Shots fired by the officer also hit the mother of Campbell daughter, resulting in serious injuries (Taylor 2017). There were two other passengers in the vehicle into which Letkeman fired.</p>
<p>The province’s Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), which examines harm done by police to civilians in Manitoba, investigated the circumstances surrounding the shooting and killing and determined that there were grounds to lay charges. The manslaughter charge is the most serious charge recommended by the IIU since it started its work in June of 2015, reinforcing the fact that police rarely face appropriate charges when they kill civilians. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office had called an inquest into Campbell&#8217;s death in August 2016.</p>
<p>The family has always viewed  the RCMP version of events as “ a joke” (Taylor 2017). From the perspective of Shannon Heck, Campbell’s younger sister, the manslaughter charges do not go far enough ad do not reflect the, in her view, murderous approach taken by Constable : “The officer is somebody who is supposed to be able to keep his calm and cool and for some reason or other he didn’t do that and he didn’t act appropriately. I don’t think charging him with manslaughter is appropriate” (quoted in Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>The RCMP claim that Steven Campbell was driving erratically when RCMP officers pulled him over. They also claim that as one officer approach the vehicle Campbell accelerated his vehicle and him. RCMP say it was only then that shots were fired. These claims have not been independently confirmed and the family says that Campbell did not accelerate and did not even hit any officer. A passenger in the vehicle says Letkeman slammed his police car into the vehicle Campbell was driving, stopping it. She also claims the officer fired nine times into the vehicle (Graham 2017). What has been confirmed is that Constable Abram Letkeman fired wildly into the vehicle hitting and killing Campbell and critically injuring his partner (Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>From the family’s understanding of events: “The story the RCMP was releasing, it was a joke as far as we were concerned. We knew something else had happened and we knew that the truth would come out” (Heck quoted in Taylor 2017). As Shannon Heck says, at the end of the day: “My brother will never be brought back” (quoted in Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>Letkeman, a seven-year veteran of the RCMP, had been deployed out of the Portage la Prairie, detachment. He has been released on bail with conditions to appear at Provincial Court in Thompson at 10 AM on March 31, 2017. He is still being paid as an officer of the RCMP as he has been since the killing in 2015.</p>

Maurice had stopped his car, but then backed up, hitting the cruiser, a review by prosecutors determined. When Maurice refused an order to get out of his car, an officer broke the window to try to open the door. Maurice grabbed him by the arm and accelerated, dragging and injuring the officer who shot Maurice. The prosecution review concluded no charges were warranted against the officer, but an inquest has been ordered.;    Persons who died IN police custody       <p>A teenager, Brandon Maurice (17), was shot and killed by an officer of the Sûreté du Québec (the Québec provincial police force) south of Maniwaki Québec early in the morning of Monday, November 16. The killing began with pursuit of a vehicle driven by the victim by Sûreté du Québec police officers around 1:30 a.m. The pursuit ended at Chemin de la Ferme and Rue Patry, close to Lac Blue Sea in the municipality of Messines at which point the Sûreté du Québec officer got out of a cruiser and approached the suspect vehicle. When the teen attempted to drive away the officer fired his weapon at him striking the young driver at least once. The teen was taken to the hospital in critical condition and police announced Monday afternoon that he had died of his wounds. The name and age of the victim were released by family. Incredibly the investigation into the killing by police is being handled by another police force with its own contentious history of killings of civilians (the Montréal police)</p>
       *<p>The Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officer who killed 17-year-old Brandon Maurice has been identified as Constable Frédéric Fortier during the coroner’s inquest into the 2015 killing. An expert in police “use of force” strategies testified at the inquest that the provincial police officer made a number of critical mistakes. A witness to the killing, Chris Houle, who was in the car with Maurice when the teenager was shot has already testified that the shooting “should have been avoided.”</p>
<p>Constable Frédéric Fortier shot the unarmed Maurice at the end of a police chase through Messines, Québec. He and his partner, Constable Dave Constantin, were cleared of criminal wrong doing after an investigation, that was in no way independent and involved Montreal police in 2016.</p>
<p>The inquest has focused on how Fortier approached the car Maurice was driving at the end of a police pursuit. He approached aggressively with his gun drawn and decided to smash the driver’s-side window to open the car door.</p>
<p>Bruno Poulin, an expert with Quebec’s police academy, so not oppositional to police in any way, testified that the encounter should never have ended with that decision. According to Poulin, the officer narrowed his options by approaching the car overly aggressively and expecting he could physically force the driver from the car. A typical thug approach by police who expect they can impose their authority without question and, if necessary, kill to deal with any mess they create.</p>
<p>In Poulin’s words to the inquest: “He put himself in danger” (quoted in 2018). Poulin said it appears that SQ officers need some retraining. We know that training does nothing to change the power police hold in society and the fact that they can kill with impunity as part of the state’s assertion of its monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>In testimony the previous day Fortier acknowledged that he had gotten himself into trouble but said he would not change his decision to shoot.</p>
<p>Brandon Maurice’s family are considering civil action against the police.</p>

       *<p>Chris Houle, the person who directly witnessed the police shooting of 17-year-old Brandon Maurice told a coroner’s inquest that it should never have happened. Houle saw the entire interaction from the passenger seat of Maurice’s car. A Sûreté du Québec (SQ), Quebec provincial police, officer shot Maurice as the teen sat in the vehicle’s driver’s seat in the early morning hours of November 16, 2015. The Inquest started in April, 2018.</p>
<p>Said Houle, during his testimony before chief coroner Catherine Rudel-Tessier on April 10: “I may not know a lot about law and police processes; I’m not an expert. But this should have been avoided” (quoted in Pfeffer 2018). The young witness testified over a day and a half.</p>
<p>The killing occurred after a police chase ended about 10 kilometers at chemin de la Ferme and rue Patry, close to Lac Blue Sea in the municipality of Messines, Quebec. Houle testified that he and Maurice sat in the car as an officer approached the driver’s side with his gun drawn. At some point the officer smashed the window and reached into the car. Some type of struggle ensued over the opening of the car door. The officer fired his gun at Maurice shooting the teenager at point-blank range.</p>
<p>Brandon Maurice died in hospital. The pathologist who carried out the autopsy testified at the inquest that Maurice died from a fatal bullet wound through this neck.</p>
<p>Family and friends of Maurice have long insisted that police used excessive force during the encounter and have demanded answers about what happened that day and why police acted the way they did. The officer responsible was not charged for the killing, a typical and in no way surprising outcome when police kill civilians in Canada. The state protects the state.</p>
<p>There is no investigation of police in Quebec that could in any way be considered independent or autonomous. Incredibly Montreal police were asked by Quebec’s police “watchdog,” Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), to conduct an investigation after the killiing. This is not independence. Not surprisingly that “investigation” decided not to charge the officer. In fact the Montreal investigators were allowed to testify at the inquest.</p>

       *<p>On January 23, 2018, it was announced that the public coroner’s inquest into the killing of 17-year-old Brandon Maurice by Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers in the Outouais will be held over the period of April 9-13, 2018. Maurice was shot and killed by SQ officers following a police vehicular pursuit on November 16, 2015. The inquest was initially planned to be held in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>The inquest will be held at the Palais de Justice in Gatineau. It will be overseen by deputy chief coroner Luc Balouin. Among those now named as being called for testimony are Dave Constantin and Frédérick Fortier of the Sûreté du Québec and Detective-Sergeant Mélanie Simard of the Montréal Police Service, which oversaw an investigation (by no means independent) into the killing.</p>
       *<p>Brandon Maurice was shot and killed by a Sûreté du Québec officer on November 16, 2015 in Messine (near Maniwaki) following a vehicular pursuit. On May 19, 2017, the province’s chief coroner,  Catherine Rudel-Tessier, ordered an inquest into the teenager’s killing by police. The inquest will be overseen by deputy chief coroner Luc Malouin. It cannot assign blame but can only make recommendations to address future such incidents. These are typically ignored or not implemented by police agencies under review.</p>
<p>Montreal police investigated their provincial colleagues, completing their examination in June 2016. Quite predictably they found for their colleague and concluded that no charges would be brought against their fellow officer. Yet the officer had fired wildly in the general direction of the driver, said to have been Maurice, and only luckily avoided hitting a passenger in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Maurice’s family was not satisfied with that investigation and found it illegitimate for police to be investigating police. In the words of Brandon Maurice’s mother, Dominique Bernier in 2016: “Police officers protect each other.” Indeed they do. The family’s view, quite reasonable, is that  investigations cannot be impartial when police investigate their colleagues. The family believes the officer used force that was excessive for a stopped car starting to drive away from an officer.</p>

An officer partially kicked in the door in and saw Gonzalez holding a toilet lid above his head. Seven officers moved in, shocked Gonzalez with a stun gun, handcuffed him and strapped him to a stretcher for transfer under the Mental Health Act. Rodrigo died the next day in hospital. Police said later Gonzales had been armed with a screwdriver, though the investigation didn't find one at the scene. Investigators said they found no evidence of excessive force.       *<p>On November 7, 2017, Rodrigo Hector Almonacid Gonzalez, a hospital worker and father of two young sons, died from injuries sustained in an interaction with Toronto police. Less than a day before more than ten Toronto Police officers, including a tactical squad equipped with a battering ram and shields, had forced their way into the Gonzalez home where the 43 year old occupant had apparently locked himself in his bathroom for reasons yet unknown. During the police encounter two Tasers were deployed against Gonzalez and he was taken from the building on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Photographs taken by Gonzalez’s wife at the hospital reveal horrific injuries including a bloody head injury, a black eye, bruising on an arm and shoulder, and what the family believes to be a Taser mark near the victim’s groin. The family was notified that Gonzalez had internal bleeding shortly before he succumbed to his injuries. His mother and wife reported than he had no injuries before police arrived. They also reported being kept from entering the apartment by police officers.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, despite the injuries sustained by the victim in his encounter with police and despite his death in hospital the next day, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), tasked with investigating all such incidents of police involved civilian harm, took five days before showing up at the apartment to investigate. The family was not told to preserve the scene in the bathroom where the encounter is believed to have occurred and it is not clear if essential evidence has been lost as a result. SIU should have attended and secured the scene directly once it was reported.</p>
<p>Toronto police have refused to comment on the case but an SIU spokesperson confirmed that police reported the incident the day it happened and notified the SIU when Gonzalez died the next day. No answer has been given by SIU for why it took their investigators four days to contact the family. Three SIU investigators and one forensic investigator have since been assigned to the case.</p>

Police said when they spotted Sefa's van they attempted to pull him over, but a pursuit resulted. Informed Sefa was suicidal and likely armed with a gun, police conducted a high-risk takedown, forcing Sefa's vehicle to stop. Four officers leaped from their cars, three with guns drawn. Police said when Sefa pointed a handgun at the officer who didn't have a gun in his hand, the three other officers opened fire, killing Sefa. The investigation cleared the officers.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       <p>A 44 year old man, later identified as Haki Sefa, was shot dead by Winnipeg police late Sunday night, September 20, 2015. Sefa, a father of four who worked as a plumber, died from wounds received during an interaction with police on Highway 59 near Kirkness Road north of Winnipeg. He had been followed by police after a call was put in by a family member concerned about his well being.</p>
<p>Early reports suggested that Sefa had become depressed, perhaps suicidal, following the death of his niece Breanna Kannick, whom he helped raise, last month. Sadly the young woman was herself a victim of police intervention, having died in a Regina jail cell from apparent drug withdrawal under troubling circumstances about which there have been many questions raised but not yet answered.</p>

After an ASIRT investigation it was determined that the officer who shot Prasad would not be charged. Calgary police have since brought in guidelines that restrict officers from shooting at suspects in moving vehicles.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>Calgary police have extra-judicially executed a man who was only suspected of robbery. The man was shot and killed by police at a condominium parkade in the southeast part of the city, Inglewood. According to police, a resident of the SoBow condominiums called police after believing to have seen four men looking at vehicles. The victim has been identified by friends as Sanjai Prasad (41).</p>
<p>Police blocked off exits of the parkade and entered in search of the men. Police opened fire on a vehicle containing four men. The driver was struck and killed. The other three men were arrested. The vehicle was contained within an empty parking garage and posed no immediate threat to the public. Other details have not been disclosed including why the police believed that vehicle to be stolen or why they thought killing someone was an appropriate response to suspected theft. The condo complex had been the site of a fear and surveillance campaign with notices about a previous theft being circulated and residents being encouraged to call police.</p>
<p>Calgary police immediately began a concerted effort to discredit and smear the victim with public statements about his criminal record (which is irrelevant and does not justify the police execution since they only identified the man after the fact). Yet friends tell a very different, more complete story. According to friend Stacey Halvorsen:</p>
<p>“He was a totally genuine, big hearted person. He always put his friends before himself and he was just… I know what it says about him on his record and stuff, but that’s not how he came across to me, you know? He wasn’t violent. I’ve known him for a really long time and I’ve never seen him angry. He was always happy. Unfortunately, you know, his past is making him look like he&#8217;s a bad guy, and he wasn’t.” (quoted in Anderson 2016)</p>
<p>Prasad was helping a farmer girlfriend raise a young boy.</p>
<p>The trial by media and police orchestrated trials by media have been common tactics. Calgary police have recently been criticized by defense lawyers for running trial by media campaigns in another case (see Bell 2016).</p>
<p>The real issue here is that once again the police are ready and willing to kill in service of their role of defenders of property. Suspected theft should in no way be an executable offense. Yet this defense of property, even over and above the lives of the working class and poor, is the original and foundational function of policing.</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Team (ASIRT), which investigates acts of violence involving police in the province, will look at the case.</p>

An independent investigation found that after officers put the mother in the backseat of a police car, they entered the home and tried but failed to subdue Mutch with a beanbag projectile. Mutch charged at them with a knife, and police opened fire. His mother heard over the police radio that her son had been shot in the neck. Mutch bled out at the scene.;    Officers responded to Mutch holding a knife; shot him when he moved toward them; Coroner's Service yet to announce investigation; Police shooting; Police shooting; Police responded to call from mother; Rhett had expressed desire to end his life;    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>This project has documented the bogus nature of “suicide by cop” as a means to excuse police killings of civilians. It is a form of copaganda used as a legitimation tool by so-called oversight agencies (none of which are autonomous and independent from police with powers of compulsion) and state inquests to justify police killings of civilians to an anxious and critical public. The reasons for the bogus nature of this claim are numerous and have been laid out here previously. The claim is only applied after the fact in diverse situations and ignores the fact that unlike in other suicides the victim is killed, not by their own actions, but by the conscious decision of someone who chooses to use lethal force rather choosing not to kill.</p>
<p>Once again this phony “finding” has been used to legitimate the lethal actions of a killer cop. The killing of 20-year-old Victoria youth Rhett Mutch by police constable John Musicco has been declared a suicide by a coroner’s inquest in findings announced May 19, 2017. Incredibly the inquest report offered no reasons for why the jury classified the killing as a suicide. Constable Musicco had already been cleared by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that examines cases of police violence against civilians in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Musicco shot Mutch in the neck killing him  on November 1, 2014. At the time he was shot the young man was alone in the basement of his mother’s house and posed no threat to his mother (who was safely outside the house) or to the general public.</p>
<p>The report even noted in detail an exchange between Marney Mutch, the victim’s mother, and police officers in which she told them that her son would not hurt anyone. She also informed them that drawn guns would only frighten her distraught son further. She told the inquest that one of the officers held a gun that looked like “a bazooka.” This is another problem of &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuses. They ignore the role of police actions in changing victim&#8217;s interactions. In her view, as stated in the report: “This is really overkill.” She wanted to stay in the house with her son but officers refused her request.</p>
       *<p>More than two years ago a Victoria mother’s plea for help for her son ended with police taking the young man’s life. Rhett Mutch was shot and killed inside his mom’s home by Constable John Musicco. Mutch posed no threat to the public. In a 911 call made by Marney Mutch she told the operator that her son would not do anything to physically hurt her. While Musicco was, predictably, cleared of any wrongdoing in killing Rhett Mutch by the provincial investigation unit for British Columbia, a coroner’s inquest is looking into the killing.</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was killed by Constable Musicco on November 1, 2014. Marney Mutch had called 911 after her son broke into the basement of her home on Dallas Road in Victoria. Several police officers entered the home, killing Mutch within only minutes of their arrival.</p>
<p>The inquest which started May 15, 2017 has focused on misinformation apparently passed from the 911 operator to police. In the 911 call, which was played for the coroner’s jury, Marney Mutch said that her son had a knife, but would not use it to hurt her and further told the operator that he was holding it by his stomach. In the dispatch audio, a police dispatcher is heard saying that Rhett Mutch was holding the knife to his throat.</p>
<p>Victoria Police Sergeant Gregory Holmes,  the supervisor the day of the incident testified to the jury on Monday, May 15 but could not answer why police responded with force if Marney Mutch was not in danger and simply wanted help for her son. It is not clear either why police went after Rhett Mutch who was by then alone in the house, his mother having left safely when police arrived.</p>
       *<p>The secrecy that surrounds information about officers involved in the deaths of civilians, and the fact that officers who kill people are not readily named in the Canadian context, extends to information about the circumstances of police killings of civilians.</p>
<p>Details about police killings of civilians typically only emerge in cases in which charges are brought and which end up in court, since court proceedings are public in Canada, or in certain cases that are reviewed by provincial oversight bodies, where they exist, or in coroners’ inquiries. In cases in which other police forces investigate their fellow police information is not forthcoming. Even in cases that are reviewed by oversight agencies or coroners’ inquiries details can be obscure or conflicting. Yet having some access to witness accounts or evidence and cross examination from lawyers of victims’ families can provide some of the only opportunities for the public to have any insights into the horrible situations faced by victims in their final moments or in events that would lead to their deaths subsequently.</p>
<p>The transcripts of responses to investigators offer some too little seen insights into police encounters with people experiencing mental health crises and show, in a startling and awful way, how quickly police can escalate situations and how single minded (and unforgiving) they are in seeking compliance from people who are clearly distraught, even confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubling Encounters: The Police Killing of Rhett Mutch</p>
<p>Details released at the conclusion of an Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigation into the shooting and killing of 20-year-old Rhett Mutch by a Vitoria Police Department officer show the deeply disturbing actions undertaken by police in a situation in which a young man experiencing mental health issues is confronted by officers set on achieving compliance. The following accounts are from that IIO report as reported in Petrescu (2016).</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was shot and killed by police on the morning of November 1, 2014, in his mother’s home. She had called 911 at 10:51 AM after her son had broken into her home. The two had been texting for some time before the son entered his mother’s house. At the time he was under a court order not to contact her or visit her house. Marney Mutch informed the 911 dispatcher of this. In the kitchen Rhett Mutch took a steak knife with a serrated edge and held it to his stomach (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Lowering the knife Rhett Mutch moved into the living room and sat down on a couch. The 911 dispatcher informed Marney Mutch that police had arrived and told her to leave the house. She refused to leave her son and informed that operator that he was now pointing the knife at the floor and she believed that her son would not harm her (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Within four minutes of the initial call to 911 two Victoria police officers arrived at Marney Mutch’s house. Others were dispatched and on their way. The situation was described by dispatcher to officers as involving a man with a knife to his throat. A supervisor reportedly suggested the officers should “try and probe, use cover, initiate dialogue” (Petrescu 2016). It seems that the officer did not take this approach in engaging Rhett Mutch.</p>
<p>When Marney Mutch opened the door to meet police she was startled to see the officers approaching her front door with a large gun. She asked: “Whoa. What is that for?” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). The ensuing conversation unfolded as follows according to the investigation report.</p>
<p>The officer upon entering responded: “He’s armed.”</p>
<p>Mutch clarified: “He’s got a kitchen knife and he’s not going to hurt anybody with it.”</p>
<p>The officer asserted their need to protect her and informed her that they had a beanbag gun.</p>
<p>Mutch expressed that she did not fear her son: “He’s not going to hurt me. He’s not going to hurt anybody.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the gun wielded by police Marney Mutch further explained to investigators: “So like, I wanted him to go away with it. He didn’t. It was frightening. It was only going to scare the hell out of him … He had tears in his eyes.”</p>
<p>The officer insisted that she not stay in the house. Two more officers entered the house as Marney Mutch exited. She noticed one of the officers carrying a weapon that she described as looking like a bazooka. She again expressed her concerns: “This is really overkill.” Instead of taking her advice or consulting her further Marney Mutch was made to sit inside a police car away from her son.</p>
<p>There was a sense that the number of officers in his immediate space frightened or agitated Mutch. Officers suggested a change in his demeanor at their presence. A neighbor is recorded in the report saying he heard police repeatedly shouting at the young man and this could be heard from outside the house.</p>
<p>For their part the officers involved told investigators that they were not sure if anyone else was in the house at the time of the encounter. They suggested this ratcheted up their sense of urgency and concern that someone else could be harmed. The presence or not of others, however, could have been determined by asking Marney Mutch. In any event, the IIO noted that this was a serious communication failure by the officers involved.</p>
<p>At 11:02 AM an officer inside the house with a beanbag gun fired at Mutch hitting him in the thigh but apparently not knocking him down (Petrescu 2016). Officers stated that they felt confined with too little room to move quickly or to retreat. This was another serious failing of the police response. Another officer fired hitting Mutch in the neck causing the victim to bleed severely. Paramedics would arrive five minutes later but there were no signs of life and Rhett Mutch was pronounced dead at 11:29 AM.</p>
<p>The IIO cleared the police officer who killed Mutch. Use of force was declared to be justified, the typical ruling from oversight bodies in Canada. In its statement the office concluded:</p>
<p>“There is no evidence to support that the involved officers had any malice against, or motivation to do harm to, the affected person or use any force against him other than what was reasonably necessary to take him into lawful custody” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>The IIO also concluded that the Victoria Police Department was not criminally negligent in their fateful decision to confront Rhett Mutch rather than withdrawing from the house to a safer barricade position from which they, or a mental healthcare person, could negotiate.</p>
<p>Once again concerns were raised about the timeframe of the IIO investigation. It took a rather tardy 19 months to complete, an issue that IIO critics note has become standard for the unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serious Questions</p>
<p>IIO Chair Marten Youseff reported that the events surrounding the killing of Rhett Mutch raised serious questions for officers regarding the actions of the Victoria Police Department. According to the report: “Unfortunately, significant communication failures led to different perspectives amongst different officers as to the need to immediately confront the affected person” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet there is no explanation for the confusion on this given that Marney Mutch had spoken of the lack of immediate (or looming) threat both to the 911 dispatcher and to the officers at the scene. And police knew that she was inside a police vehicle and thus facing no threat at all at the time police entered the house.</p>
<p>The IIO report concludes: “Given the totality of the circumstances, there are significant questions that need to be asked as to why the officers were inside the residence at all, at the moment the shots were fired” (quoted in Lupick 2016).</p>
<p>Of particular concern for investigators was the fact that the officers involved did not know who was in the house when they entered. This despite the obvious, acknowledged, presence of the mother and the opportunity to speak with her (as at least one officer did). The officer who shot Mutch claimed that he would have proceeded differently, setting up an armed barricade and not entering the house, if he had been aware that no one else was inside or that Mutch was suicidal (Petrescu 2016). The number of officers in a tight space was said to limit their options. Neither pepper spray nor baton were deemed viable in that context.</p>
<p>Despite the findings of the investigation and the description of what happened by Marney Mutch the Victoria Police Department continued to portray officers as trying to de-escalate the situation. In a statement released following the IIO report, Victoria police chief Del Manak stated:</p>
<p>“In addition to the grief and sorrow this has caused the family, this incident has had a profound effect on the officers who were involved. Despite their training, experience, the action plan they developed for this dynamic situation, and their attempts to de-escalate the situation, this incident ended in tragedy.” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>Yet this was a tragedy that need not have occurred.</p>
<p>Victoria police were presented with the IIO report and insisted they will work with the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner to examine departmental protocols. In a statement they claim: “we remain committed to continual assessment of our practices. This is especially important given the steadily increasing number of calls from the public requesting that our officers attend to people experiencing some form of crisis” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet in case after case in the Canadian context, regardless of jurisdiction police are responding to people experiencing crisis with a “comply or die” focus, aggression, violence, and ultimately lethal force.</p>
<p>And when police act in these encounters they tend to act aggressively and quickly with no sense of attempts at de-escalation or communication. According to the IIO report, only between five and six minutes passed between the time at which Victoria police officers made contact with Mutch and the discharge of a firearm. As Lupick notes, that is significantly longer than is often the case in other police shootings in British Columbia. Lupick notes that there is a pattern in fatal encounters involving police and civilians in the province. It is, in fact, common for police to have fired their weapons within the first few minutes of contact with someone experiencing mental health issues or personal crisis, often discharging weapons within the first 60 seconds of contact (Lupick 2016). Clearly this shows that virtually no efforts are made a de-escalation or discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Following the release of the IIO investigation report Marney Mutch told reporters that in her view it was the actions of police and their hard response that led to an intensification of her son’s behavior. In particular she noted the presence of large, ominous looking, weapons, the number of officers confronting her son, five, and the fact that they cornered her son in a single room. In her view: “They created the situation that led to my son being shot” (quoted in Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>She believes that her son Rhett did not want to die and would not have killed himself and she is confident that she was never in danger from her son. In her words: “There was nothing aggressive about him” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). In the view of Marney Mutch, and indeed of many commentators and critics, it is the wrong approach to aggressively confront someone, particularly with weapons, experiencing a mental health crisis (Petrescu 2016). She has added her voice to the call from others for improved training for police in dealing with people experiencing mental health emergencies.</p>

As the officer struggled to make the arrest, Lance Cutarm and his brothers got out and ""fanned out"" around the officer, who was on his own. The officer fatally shot Lance Cutarm and wounded one of his brothers. The family says the officer's reponse to ""perceived danger"" was racial. An investigative report found no evidence the officer's actions were racially motivated.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>The family of Lance Cutarm (30), member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation, is suing the RCMP officer who killed him during a 2013 traffic stop near Pigeon Lake, Alberta.</p>
<p>On August 3, a vehicle driven by Lawrence Cutarm and his three sons, including Lance Cutarm, was pulled over by RCMP officer Corporal Kevin Krebs. The lawsuit claims that Corporal Krebs became violent with Lawrence Cutarm outside the vehicle, without warning striking him on the head and handcuffing his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>Lance Cutarm and his two brothers, all of whom were outside the vehicle, asked Krebs to stop using force against their father. The lawsuit claims the three were running away from Krebs when he opened fire, fatally shooting Lance in the chest and striking his older brother, Laron Cutarm, twice in the torso.</p>
<p>The claim states that the brothers “were not acting in a threatening manner to Krebs or to anyone, and this use of deadly force was unnecessary, excessive and unlawful.” The suit also claims: “The RCMP members’ conduct constitutes an arbitrary and malicious punishment and a malicious exercise of their authority.”</p>
<p>While criminal charges were initially laid against Lawrence and Laron Cutarm they were withdrawn by a prosecutor in May 2014.</p>
<p>In January, Alberta’s police watchdog, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) reported that this lethal interaction with the RCMP started because Krebs pulled the Cutarms’ truck over after a passenger gave him the middle finger as they drove by him.</p>
<p>The family is suing the officer for $650,000.</p>

When they arrived on scene, police said, de Groot refused to accompany them, entered a cabin and fired a rifle at them before retreating into the woods. A five-day search ended, police said, when they opened a door to a cabin and found de Groot lying ""on his front"" and pointing a gun at them. Police opened fire and de Groot died on scene. No charges were laid, but de Groot's sister has filed a civil claim against the RCMP.       *<p>RCMP shot and killed Peter DeGroot in 2014 after tracking him to an isolated cabin in a remote woods near Slocan, British Columbia. It took the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) an outrageously long period of nearly four years to issue their report into the killing, which they finally did on March 29, 2018. Not surprisingly they cleared the officers involved in the killing of DeGroot. Broader questions remain about why they targeted and tracked the man who seemed only to want to be left alone in the woods.</p>
<p>It has been stated by police that the events leading to DeGroot’s killing began when RCMP officers responded to reports of a dispute between two people on October 9, 2014. DeGroot fled into the woods. Police initiated a search by officers, deploying helicopters and dogs. Police found DeGroot alone in a cabin four days later while out in the woods on unrelated business. Initial evidence and a first coroner’s report suggested that DeGroot had been shot in the back. Some have speculated that the drawn out investigation was really about finding time to patch together an alternative conclusion more favorable to police.</p>
<p>The IIO report concludes: “The evidence collected does not provide sufficient grounds to consider any charges against any officer. The evidence does offer support to the conclusion that the officers acted as required by their duties and in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>RCMP deputy commissioner Brenda Butterworth-Carr has lauded the work of new IIO chief civilian director Ronald MacDonald since he took over the post a year ago and says he has given her confidence that trust in the IIO will be renewed by police. This should given anyone concerned about police oversight and independent review great cause for concern.</p>

McCaffrey, in a state of distress and wielding two knives, was shocked with a stun gun when he was seen to injure himself. When that failed to stop him, one of the officers shot McCaffrey twice. He was rushed to the hospital where he died of his wounds. An independent investigation found the officer used reasonable force in the incident.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       *<p>Police in Rothesay, New Brunswick have fought to keep body camera footage of the killing of William David McCaffrey by an officer of the Kennebecasis Regional Police Force from the public. On July 27, 2017, the access to information and privacy commissioner for the province called for release of the tape.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old youth was shot and killed by police in his home on February 28, 2014, while experiencing mental health distress. McCaffrey was shot twice while harming himself. The force was not investigated by a civilian oversight unit but only by another police force, the RCMP. The finding for release of the tape comes after a 15-month battle over access to information by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).</p>
<p>Commissioner Anne Bertrand in deciding the case determined that public interest in police use of force cases supercedes privacy, including for police. This ruling could have something to say about who is able to see police body camera footage in the future. In an interview Bertrand clarified: “In special circumstances, there may be a public interest in the public knowing about what happened, despite there being personal information involved” (quoted in Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>The Kennebecasis Regional Police Force had denied a request from CBC News of information of footage from a police body camera in 2016. They cited privacy concerns.</p>
<p>CBC News appealed the police decision to Bertrand. The news station argued that body-worn camera footage should be treated the same way as any other record showing how police make a decision (2017). According to the CBC News claim: “Having access to those records is necessary to ensure public safety and accountability” (quoted in Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>In her decision, Bertrand invoked a little used public interest section of the Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. It says that in cases where there is “a risk of significant harm,” which could include a danger to public safety, that section can override other parts of the law that protect privacy (Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>This would be the first case of release of police body camera footage in the Canadian context, unlike the situation in the United States in which such footage has been released numerous times. As is too often the case in public body decisions involving police conduct, the police force is not required to adhere to Bertrand’s decision and is already pursuing legal advice. Once again the police assume the powers of a law unto themselves.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly rare for police officers who kill civilians to be subjected to any punishment. Charges are almost never laid and full trials virtually never held. Killer cops are certainly treated to a different, and decidedly favorable response, from the criminal justice system than are civilians who kill. This is in no way surprising. As we have documented repeatedly, the state protects its officers.

As the inquest continues, on July 26, another police officer, Durham Regional Police Constable Mark Brown, has added to the questionable police testimony by suggesting that the dying victim played a part in his own death by actively resisting help.  Brown was the first to respond to a 911 call involving Michael MacIsaac on that morning on December 2, 2013. MacIsaac was shot by Taylor while he was experiencing effects of an epileptic seizure and was naked in the street near his home.</p>
<p>In Brown&#8217;s own testimony: “I remember him saying stuff, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The only thing I understood when performing first aid, was MacIsaac said ‘pain’ (quoted in McLaughlin 2017). That seems clear enough. But the cop wants the jury to believe the dying man did not want the pain to stop.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family lawyer, Roy Wellington questioned Constable Brown about his claim that MacIsaac resisted help. Asked Wellington: “Does it strike you as odd that someone would not want to be touched after being shot by the same people” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)? Brown could not offer such empathetic insight.</p>
<p>Family members in attendance at the inquest were dumbfounded at the officer’s testimony. Said Brian MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne:  “I can’t imagine what was going through Michael’s head, and know the pain must have been horrible. But to tell him after the fact, we are here to help you? It’s ridiculous, ridiculous to me. Why didn&#8217;t you help him before?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017).  Joanne MacIsaac suggested that the officer’s testimony was not close to believable. She continued in frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“His narrative of what happened has got to be, in my opinion, fabricated. To say Michael was actively resisting when he’s naked, cold on the ground and you&#8217;re pushing in on his abdomen after he has been shot, to use the phrase ‘he’s actively resisting,’ my god what is the matter with these people?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under cross examination by Anita Szigeti, a lawyer with Toronto’s Empowerment Council for people with mental health issues, Constable Brown, an officer with 14 years of experience on the force had undertaken only one week of mental health training ever and that had occurred a decade before the killing of Michael MacIsaac. Brown had to admit on the stand that his training was not adequate.</p>

       *<p>Killer cop Brian Taylor provided two days of questionable, even outright unbelievable, testimony during the coroner’s inquest into his 2013 killing of 47-year-old Michael MacIsaac. As witnesses and 911 call evidence contradicted much of his depiction of events, Constable Taylor turned to the bogus and obnoxious “excited delirium” excuse to blame the victim. Notably the inquest testimony was the first time he raised this baseless suggestion, a last refuge of killer cops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contradicted Testimony</p>
<p>Taylor claims he feared for his life when seeing MacIsaac, yet he was safely inside his police vehicle and decided to exit only after seeing the man he was supposedly threatened by near him. Taylor claimed in his testimony that he heard MacIsaac say “Come on, come on,” and claims that he issued the police challenge, “Police. Don’t move,” to MacIsaac and remembers hearing it.</p>
<p>Taykor testified at length:</p>
<p>“Somebody said ‘Drop it, get down on the ground.’ I thought that if I have to take a shot, don’t miss. There are a lot of people around. Then he moved off the curb. I fired the first round. I didn’t hear the gun go off. I felt it . . . . I didn’t know if I had hit him, because there was no effect. And he continued to move and I fired a second round and I know that one struck him.” (quoted in Gallant 2017a)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wellington, the MacIsaac family’s lawyer, used cross-examination to note that most of Constable Taylor’s claims about what was said are not captured on a 911 call made by Ron Nino the witness who stopped the arriving Taylor and told him MacIsaac was in the area. On that call a voice is heard telling Nino “get back, get back” (Gallant 2017a). Only seconds later shots are fired. No one is heard at any point either issuing commands to MacIsaac or saying “Come on, come on.” Nino said that Taylor fired almost immediately. The MacIsaac family had that call analyzed by a forensic scientist to see if there were cuts or absences. That report concluded that “there are no definite signs of alterations or breaks found on this recording” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>Queried Wellington: “I’m having a hard time understanding how we can hear someone further away from Mr. Nino, but we don’t actually hear you issuing any commands at all” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Wellington continued: ““Regardless of who shouted commands, there wasn’t much of an opportunity for Mr. MacIsaac to respond. Would you agree with that?” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Constable Taylor offered the rather desperate response that perhaps the cell phone malfunctioned. This despite the forensic tests. Taylor’s lawyer, Bill MacKenzie tried to suggest that 911 called Nino back and thus interfered with the call, which, frankly, makes no sense.</p>
<p>Questions are also being asked why Taylor shot MacIsaac twice and how he could not see if the first shot hit the man, since he was naked and there were no clothes to obscure a bullet strike and wound. Incredibly, Taylor believed the victim was “still a threat” even after he saw black-red blood streaming out of the stricken man’s abdomen. Two other officers took time to handcuff the dying man rather than giving him any medical attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constable Taylor Proposes Phoney “Excited Delirium”</p>
<p>Taylor, desperately and pathetically, tried to introduce the phony notion of “excited delirium” to describe MacIsaac and justify the killing. Excited delirium is a bogus claim produced by police and police associations after the fact when they kill someone. Incredibly Taylor suggested this was his first thought when hearing over police that the person he was seeking might be suffering mental health issues. The family suggests that MacIsaac was in crisis as a result of an epileptic seizure but did not have mental health issues.</p>
<p>Anita Szigeti, a lawyer for the Empowerment Council, an advocacy group for people with lived experiences of mental health and addiction issues noted that organizations including the World Health Organization and American Medical Association do not recognize it as an actual condition (Gallant 2017b). Szigeti rightly pointed out that the only ones who maintain that it is a condition are the “maker of Tasers” and law enforcement members (Gallant 2017b). We might add pro-police criminologists or copagandists.</p>
<p>Szigeti posed this to Constable Taylor. In her words: “But, do you know ‘excited delirium’ is extremely controversial, over whether it’s even a condition at all?” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). Taylor answered simply, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Szigeti said that she was puzzled because Taylor promoted the notion of excited delirium at the inquest but the term does not appear anywhere in his notes on the shooting. Neither does it appear in his interviews with the Special Investigations Unit or the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>This led Szigeti to conclude: “I’m going to suggest to you that you never thought about ‘excited delirium’ at all until long after the events when you shot Mr. MacIsaac” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). This at base the nature of this phony claim. It is an after the fact justification for killer cops desperate for an answer when all reasonable explanations are absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Joanne MacIsaac, Michael MacIsaac’s sister, is also asking if the SIU bothered to listen to the Nino 911 call in its investigation into the killing which resulted in a decision not to bring criminal charges against Constable Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor ended his testimony, on its second day, with the admission, in response to a question from a juror: “With hindsight being 20/20, yes, there probably could have been a better way to resolve it” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>

       *<p>Constable Brian Taylor (46), the Durham police officer who shot and killed Michael MacIsaac took the stand July 20, 2017 for his first day of testimony at the coroner’s inquest into the killing. Taylor shot and killed MacIsaac, who was clearly in distress, on December 2, 2013 in Ajax, Ontario. The officer’s testimony raised many serious questions about his actions and aspects of his account have been contradicted by witnesses who have already testified.</p>
<p>Constable Taylor shot Michael MacIsaac within seconds of encountering the distressed man who was in the street naked. Taylor claims that MacIsaac came at him with a table leg and that he feared for his life. Yet witnesses have testified that MacIsaac was not holding any table leg at the time he was shot. A patio table leg allegedly retrieved at the scene was lightweight and hollow.  Taylor testified that it was obvious to him that MacIsaac was in distress as soon as he saw the man. Yet he did nothing to de-escalate the situation. This despite the fact that two other police officers were already at the scene. No warning was issued to MacIsaac by any officer before the shooting.</p>
<p>Serious questions remain about why Constable Taylor fired a second shot at the already stricken man. It is also uncertain why Taylor exited his police car to confront the man if he feared for his life. He would have been entirely safe against the naked man from within his police vehicle. These issues raise troubling questions about the actions taken by Constable Taylor</p>
       *<p>Constable Brian Taylor has been identified as the Durham police officer who shot and killed 47-year-old Michael MacIsaac on December 2, 2013 in a residential neighborhood in Ajax, Ontario. Constable Taylor shot Mr. MacIsaac twice within 12 seconds of exiting his police cruiser. The coroner’s inquest in to the killing started in July 2017 and Taylor is scheduled to testify during the week of July 17, likely on July 20. As is the case for most killer cops, Officer Taylor was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in two previous reviews, one by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, and the second by the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family has always maintained that the victim was struggling with an epilepsy-related incident in which he ran into the street naked and engaged with passing drivers. This had followed a  confrontation inside a family house involving MacIsaac, his wife, and her sister.</p>
<p>The inquest and its jury of four men and one woman have already heard from Michael MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne MacIsaac, and his wife, Marianne Madjarian. Marianne Madjarian, testified on July 17, that in her view something was wrong with her husband on the morning of the shooting. She had not witnessed any comparable behavior previously, and was, thus, unsure what she should do. She said that he loved his family very much and had no history of violence. In her testimony, Joanne MacIsaac explained her brother’s history of epileptic seizures and the prolonged states of confusion that followed from them. She related that she had spoken to her brother two days before he was shot and in her view he seemed to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>The family has been insistent that they do not want this inquiry to make a familiar recommendation of increased taser use. This is neither appropriate nor effective for people in health distress. In Joanne MacIsaac’s words:  “In my opinion, the people who are being shot and killed by police are not the people shooting back, they are the vulnerable sector of society. I know additional Taser use comes out in all these inquests. I don’t think that’s the answer” (quoted in Powers 2017). Instead people in distress need to be given more care and time.</p>
<p>As Madjarian said: “He was in a mental health crisis, which is apparent when you’re running around naked on a cold morning. He needed help. He was not a criminal” (quoted in Powers 2017). Regardless, police are killing too many people, for doing little, who pose no real threat to them</p>

The problems with this notion have been detailed and analyzed repeatedly in this project. Applied after the fact and in a range of instances, including those in which the cop killed someone who posed no threat to police or the public, the excuse covers up killings which are in no way suicides. If a police officer chooses to shoot someone who is isolated from the public and poses no threat to anyone, that is not suicide. If the cop has a choice not to kill, that killing is not a suicide. Saying it is denies the dignity of the victim who has not chosen to  end their own life. It has been consciously ended for them. Without consent. Suicide by cop is in these cases purely propagandistic.</p>
<p>Yet killer cops, their departments, and police associations routinely trot this piece of copaganda out in diverse circumstances. Such is the case of Toronto Constable James Focillo who shot 18-year-old Sammy Yatim multiple times while the youth was all alone and readily contained on an inoperative and empty streetcar. Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to six years in prison for the 2013 killing of Yatim. Forcillo is now appealing his conviction on the basis that testimony arguing for “suicide by cop” in Yatim’s case was excluded from the trial. The testimony was provided from cop “criminologist” Rick Parent of Simon Fraser University who has built a tidy side career on justifying “suicide by cop” claims by his colleagues who kill.</p>
<p>The suicide by cop claim is ludicrous in this case. First, Yatim was alone and contained and posed no threat to the public or police. Secondly, Forcillo fired two distinct volleys of multiple shots at the youth, pausing before shooting the second volley even after the young man had fallen dead from the first round of shots. Clearly not a suicide. Forcillo had multiple opportunities not to shoot and to stop shooting. There is no way to construe that as a suicide on Yatim’s part.</p>
<p>Forcillo, who is currently on bail pending the appeal, is asking for a not guilty verdict or a new trial. Forcillo is asking the appeal court, which is set to hear his case this fall, to substitute a not-guilty verdict or order a new trial. The killer cop is also seeking a declaration that his mandatory minimum sentence for attempted murder is unconstitutional, and seeks a suspended sentence. Absent these outcomes he wants his sentence reduced to the minimum of five years.</p>

The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

       *<p>There used to be an old saying, “Help the police, beat yourself up.” Now Michael Edelson, the lawyer for killer Ottawa cop Daniel Montsion, wants a court and the public to believe that the vicious beating his client inflicted on 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi had nothing to do with killing him. Instead, he suggests Abdi died of a heart attack. And he apparently wants people to believe that, even if he did have a heart attack, a severe beating with baton by police did not play a part in it. So, according to copagandist Edelson, Abdi is responsible for his own death: not the brutal assault he was subjected to. Maybe he beat himself to death.</p>
<p>Edelson made these absurd and offensive claims in an attempt to move up the court date for officer Montsion. According to audio court transcripts from the October 20 hearing, Edelson suggested: “This is not a beating that caused the death of Mr. Abdi. Mr. Abdi died of a heart attack. That’s what killed him.” Montsion has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in the killing of Abdi in July 2016.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s request to move the trial date was denied. The 12-week trial remains scheduled to start in February 2019, which is almost three years after Abdi’s killing.</p>
       *<p>Observant commentators have suggested that police actually operate like a gang, closing ranks unquestioningly to support their own no matter how egregious the member’s actions may have been. While there is some truth in this, police are not quite like gangs in that they lack the honor of gangs who at least have some limits, some acts they will not tolerate among members. If anyone needs a case in point they need only look at the dubious activities of the Ottawa Police Association and Ottawa police officers in response to the killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a Somalian-Canadian man suffering mental distress who was beaten to death by Constable Daniel Montsion in July of 2016. Montsion had previously expressed a problem with a suspect who was Somalian.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 29, 2017, the first day of preliminary court procedures leading to Montsion’s trial for manslaughter, several Ottawa police officers wore blue and black rubber wristbands stating “United We Stand #1998.” The number printed on the band is actually Montsion’s badge number. The rubber band bracelets are being sold for $2 apiece with the money going to the Ottawa Police Association.</p>
<p>This open show of support for a killer cop whose brutal beating of the defenseless man was partly caught on video is a tasteless and provocative move in a context that is already heated and where community members have mobilized against racist policing. It is an arrogant move that is clearly an attempt to put pressure on the court even as police say they do not comment on cases before the courts.</p>
<p>Incredibly the cops are using the excuse that it is a measure to address the trauma officers face on the job. This is part of a growing campaign to pose police crimes as primarily being about traumas for officers who then need more public money and resources for support. Some paid “criminologists” are being mustered to lend a veneer of credibility to the trauma money appeals led by police associations. Those same bought “criminologists” show little to no regard for the victims of police violence.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice for Abdirahman Abdi campaign, William Felepchuk, calls the bracelets an “outrage.” He notes that the nature of the crime Monsion is accused of is severe and suggest the move is an interference in the criminal justice process. Felepchuk further notes that police would not be so welcoming of civilians wearing such arm bands in cases of someone accused of killing a police officer.</p>
<p>Police always have pressures, both overt like the arm bands and covert like implied non-cooperation with prosecution, to apply on broader criminal justice processes. One should not expect anything resembling justice from the state in its dealings with killer cops.</p>
       *<p>The killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year old Somali Canadian man, by Ottawa Police Constable Daniel Montsion on July 24, 2016, was a particularly vicious and brutal affair which sparked community outrage and a community movement for “Justice for Abdirahman.” Montsion repeatedly delivered heavy baton blows to the defenseless man. On Monday March 6, 2017 Ontario’s police oversight agency, the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) brought three charges against Constable Montsion: manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon. Laying of charges against police officers who kill civilians is a too rare outcome in Canada.</p>
<p>The lethal beating of Abdi, a man struggling with mental health issues, while neighbors called out for the officers to stop was partially caught on video. Neighbors looked out for Abdi who was well known in the community and informed officers of his mental health issues and likely fear and lack of understanding of police commands. They implored officers to back off the frightened man but the assault with baton persisted. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the following day but family members say hospital officials told them the man was dead forty-five minutes before he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is a member of the Ottawa police direct action response team (DART) which targets gang but was assisting on patrol when he killed Abdi. Montsion has been on desk duty throughout the investigation and is now scheduled to appear at the Ontario court of justice in Ottawa on March 29. A second officer, Constable Dave Weir was involved in the assault on Abdi but the SIU concluded he was only a witness officer.</p>
<p>As reported previously by killercopscanada Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having a history of violence against Somali-Canadians. By his own admission he had “panicked” when faced with a suspect of Somali background in a case that might also have included the planting of evidence by police.</p>
<p>The police assault on Abdi began with a 911 call from a Bridgehead coffee shop in Abdi’s neighborhood in Ottawa. What happened there is still unclear but owner Tracey Clark says Abdi had made some customers feel uncomfortable or harassed. In her words:</p>
<p>“He would stand and stare at customers, or get a little bit too close, and we were beginning to hear from customers that it was making them feel uncomfortable. And so we had started to have those conversations where, ‘Are you aware of this behaviour, could we ask you not to do that?’ So there were some interventions like that that had taken place.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>After leaving the coffee shop Abdi apparently attempted to return to his apartment three blocks away. On the way he was intercepted by police. One witness, Ross McGhie reports that Abdi appeared fearful of receiving baton blows from the officer who clearly held a baton, and as a result picked up a piece of foam from the street (Nease and Pritchard 2017). He held it over his head in a defensive, not offensive, posture.</p>
<p>At some point, at the corner of Wellington and Hilda streets near Abdi’s apartment, the first officer tried to grab Abdi who dropped the foam and tried to run to his apartment building on Hilda Street. The officer prevented this by striking Abdi a few times on his legs, arms and upper body according to the witness Ross McGhie (Rease and Pritchard 2017). The officer also shouted at the stricken man.</p>
<p>At that point a second officer, said to be Constable Montsion, arrived on scene in a cruiser. He apparently moved very quickly and aggressively against the victim. In the words of McGhie: “The officer emerged from that car very rapidly &#8230; pulled up right in front of the building &#8230; immediately jumped into the altercation and administered a number of very heavy blows to the head and face and neck of Mr. Abdi” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family lawyer Lawrence Greenspon noted that family members had to endure much during the lengthy SIU investigation. In his words:</p>
<p>“It’s been extremely difficult. You not only have the incredible grief that we really can’t understand unless we go through it ourselves, and I don’t wish that on anybody. You have this grief of losing a son, brother, and it’s magnified … the public light has been shining on this death, this tragedy, for eight months now.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 20017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenspon said that the family would likely be pursuing a civil lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>The SIU report is with Ontario&#8217;s attorney general, at present Ottawa Centre Member of  Provincial Parliament Yasir Naqvi but it is not clear if Naqvi will make the report public or not. This has been a case of great public interest and concern. More than is often the case in situations involving police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi was the focus of important public mobilizations and campaigns, including mobilizations of “Black Lives Matter.” Large demonstrations calling for “Justice for Abdirahman” were held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. #justiceforabdirahman gained much attention on social media.</p>

September 9. <a href=""https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/category/justiceforabdirahman/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/category/justiceforabdirahman/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, “panicked” during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.</p>
<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion’s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion’s story conflicted both with Adoyta’s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya’s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man’s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he “sort of panicked” and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion’s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the “manner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta’s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta’s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept” (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: “This is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta” (quoted in Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.</p>
<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled “gun” around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.</p>
<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted “evidence.” So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion’s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.</p>

       *<p>The police violence inflicted on Black lives, the killing of Black people, in the Canadian context has received much less public attention, scrutiny, and response than in the United States. The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

The taxi driver dove out of the car uninjured, but Driver was shot to death by a Mountie. A joint investigation by Ontario Provincial Police and local officers found no wrongdoing in the shooting.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>The shooting and killing of Aaron Driver (24) by RCMP in Strathroy, Ontario on August 10, 2016 has, as expected, served as a launching point for a variety of government trial balloons on increasing and expanding repressive state policies and practices under the panic conditions of publicly stoked fear over domestic terrorism within Canada. Some of the early proposals from the government may suggest to the concerned observer the manifestation of a sequence on re-education or de-programing from <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. In any event it is clear that the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has served the function (perhaps intentional from the point of view of the state) of providing the necessary cover to bring forward a new regimen of repressive anti-terror governance and social regulation. Even as more questions are being raised by the circumstances of someone being killed for planning a terror attack despite the fact that the bomb he supposedly detonated on his lap was not strong enough to kill even himself (as this week’s coroner’s report showed Driver was killed by a police bullet as he was shot twice by police) (Ballingall 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear Politics and New Regimes of Repression in Canada</p>
<p>The police operation that ended in the killing of Driver was carried out within a specific context of growing calls for review, revision, or repeal of the Canadian government’s controversial and widely opposed Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as C-51). The timing of the Driver killing, in a period of public review and criticism of anti-terror legislation is not unique. Indeed previous recent cases, such as the police shooting of supposed “lone wolf” Michael Zehaf-Bibeau at Parliament Hill in 2014 and the announcement of the arrests of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in 2013 (in a case since ruled in court to be entirely police entrapment), occurred within a context of discussion over the Canadian state’s anti-terrorism regime and policies.</p>
<p>Jeff Shantz and Hisham Ramadan (2016) have outlined the political mechanisms by which fear is converted to repressive policy, particularly within the context of even events associated, even falsely, with (imagined) terrorism. Their discussions detail and explain the manipulation of state involved “terror plots” and the public discussion of responses (by police, courts, government) to them in dramatizing the need for more repressive regimes to address supposed “home grown terrorism.”</p>
<p>Only a week after the RCMP shot Aaron Driver, a young man already processed through the courts and released on an anti-terror peace bond restricting his movements and access to cell phones and the internet, and the federal Liberal government is already, again as expected, making noises about new repressive policies which would allow for increased surveillance as well as intrusive measures to control people’s “bad thoughts.”</p>
<p>In a presentation to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Ottawa, on August 17, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale revealed that the federal government is looking to make so-called counter-radicalization counselling mandatory for anyone under an anti-terrorism peace bonds. Notably, this provision has been part of C-51 but was struck down by a Winnipeg judge in the case involving Aaron Driver.</p>
<p>Goodale has insisted that a federal consultation on national security must be undertaken and he expects it to conclude by the end of 2016. Notably, Goodale has positioned this consultation as a means to innovate new repressive and intrusive measures rather than as a mechanism of ratcheting down anti-terror policies and procedures (such as ending security certificates which have been used to hold racialized, migrants under vague government claims of some association with terrorism, under conditions that violate due process or by abolishing the anti-terror list which is used to criminalize resistance movements that oppose ally states of the Canadian government).</p>
<p>Tellingly the Liberal government is using the police killing of Aaron Driver to openly promote the idea of counter-radicalization, which, in fact, they had raised before the Driver shooting and which had, at that time, raised obvious red flags for critics.  The federal government actually views the establishment of a federal office of counter-radicalization as a centerpiece of their anti-terror regime. The office of counter-radicalization would serve as “a national focal point for research, counselling and intervention services” (Bronskill 2016a). Goodale, in speaking to the chiefs of police re-stated the government’s prioritization of this center for controlling “bad thoughts” and re-education. And despite Goodale’s simultaneous claim that consultation and reflection are key to the government approach going forward he unapologetically presents this initiative as one that must happen without public consulation or review before the end of this summer. According to Goodale: “We are in the process of recruiting the person that will lead the effort. And we are determined to get this office up and running toward the end of the summer, the beginning of the fall. The incident is Strathroy demonstrates how very important this priority is” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Note that the police killing of Aaron Driver is openly asserted as the impetus for rushing the “bad thoughts” center into existence. Interestingly Goodale acknowledged that there had been efforts to de-radicalized or counsel Driver but they had not been systematic.</p>
<p>Goodale again referenced the Aaron Driver case, and what he supposedly represents, in justifying the de-radicalization, re-education center. According to Goodale, the government views as among its greatest security concerns the so-called “lone wolves” who are drawn to “extreme ideologies (Bronskill 2016a). In his words: “We need to understand what positive messages can counteract the insidious poison that draws people in, especially young people (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). No word from Goodale what the positive messages involve but one might guess from Liberal government practice they should include the benefits of war in Iraq and Syria and the selling of arms to the brutal terror regime in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale has also raised the prospect of putting people released on peace bonds under constant surveillance. He noted that Driver was not under constant surveillance, something the RCMP bemoan. According to Goodale:  “That is obviously a lesson that one needs to look at very carefully, as a result of the incident in Strathroy. And we are examining very carefully what we need to do to make our police and security activity more effective” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Again, we should remember that peace bonds can be and are placed on people under virtually no evidence at a threshold much lower than would ever lead to successful prosecution. So the real result of the government proposal would be to allow constant surveillance of people who show no or minimal signs of actually engaging in a terrorist act. Such would have been contentious to say the least before the killing of Aaron Driver. It is now a supposed necessity, a lesson learned from that case. Goodale refused to comment on whether surveillance has in fact been stepped up for the dozen or so people who are currently under anti-terrorism peace bonds (Bronskill 2016a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn Over Your Password: Invasive Policing and the Terror Panic</p>
<p>Minister Goodale was not prepared to stop there however and has raised the prospect of giving police what they want in terms of invasive policing. In his meeting with the chiefs of police Goodale also gave notice that Canadians “need to think about how far police should be allowed to go in accessing their electronic devices and communications” (Bronskill, 2016b). Indeed, following the Driver killing, the government is going to use the occasion of a federal review of cybersecurity to discuss a proposal prepared by the country’s police chiefs for a new law that would compel people to reveal their passwords with the court’s consent (Bronskill 2016b).</p>
<p>At his meeting with police chiefs, Goodale “acknowledged that smartphones contain a wealth of personal data and can reveal much more about a person than an ordinary physical search might” (Bronskill 2016b). While conceding that people do value their privacy, Goodale also suggested that people would be willing to compromise that concern in order to give police more tools, particularly to pursue terror related activities. According to Goodale: “I think Canadians recognize the imperatives on both sides” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b). Yet this is not a matter of weighing equivalences. Either police have access to deeply personal private information or they do not. And one must always ask under what circumstances they gain access. Again, connecting this access to a peace bond would be connecting it to potentially nothing in terms of real evidence or legitimate concern. Civil liberties groups and privacy critics have suggested that such legislation would be unconstitutional (something that has certainly never deterred police chiefs or their supporters in government).</p>
<p>While the public has shown no desire for such legislation or interest in debating it, Goodale is using the Driver case to suggest that debate on this policy is now needed. According to Goodale:</p>
<p>“This is a critically important subject area, and one that — for one reason or another — has not been subject to adequate public discussion. I think over the course of the fall, it will. And that will help us as a government and it will also help police forces and security agencies to define the parameters.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that there has been much public opposition to similar proposals from the former ruling Conservative government. He RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has changed the terrain of operations for the Liberal government. How fortuitous indeed.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale also used the occasion to raise the panic figure of the lone wolf in a basement. In his words:</p>
<p>“The hackers and scammers who are constantly trying to break into our information systems are a motley but potent combination of foreign states, militaries, terror groups, organized crime, petty thieves and vandals, and even that lonely computer geek in his underwear in the basement.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodale also noted that this is also a real opportunity for investment or profit for small and large firms alike. Again this is a further convergence in the anti-terror trajectory of neoliberal accumulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>All of these utterances, musings, and proposals for repressive and invasive state policies and practices have been presented within the space of only a single week following the police killing of Aaron Driver. For those of us observing and commenting on government anti-terror regimes, fear politics, and state regulatory frameworks more broadly such moves by the government after the Driver killing were, far from being surprising, actually expected at least generally if not in these specifics (see Shantz 2016).</p>
<p>In this the police killing of Aaron Driver, within the context of an as yet unconfirmed attempt at terrorism, stands with other cases such as the Germinal collective set up in 2001, the Zehaf-Bibeau killing, and the Nuttall and Korody entrapment. We should expect that further, more extensive, invasive, and punitive policies and practices will emerge and be brought forward under the guise of public consultation (framed and shadowed by the Aaron Driver case). Such is the position of the killing of Aaron Driver within the manufacture of social phobias and fear in the current social and political context within the Canadian state (a state that is, remember, active in war).</p>

       <p>Serious questions need to be asked in the wake of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) killing of supposed terror suspect Aaron Driver (24), shot by RCMP officers on August 10 following an apparent tip from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). RCMP claim Driver detonated an explosive device in a cab and that he was killed because he had access to another device.  Among the questions that require answers are how someone who was on a terror peace bond which restricted his actions and access to the internet could compile information and materials to build a bomb and build it under such conditions. It must also be answered why someone under watch by RCMP as a terror suspect was able to leave his house with two supposed bombs with no intervention beforehand (and after the supposed tip was received).</p>
<p>These questions, and questions about RCMP anti-terror operations more broadly, are particularly pressing given that the killing of Driver comes within a month of a major court decision finding that the RCMP had entrapped two poor people, dealing with mental health and addiction issues, in a phony police created and directed “terror threat.” In that case the RCMP spent millions of dollars in labor and resource to target and prime two poor residents of Surrey, B.C., John Nutall and Amanda Korody, lavishing gifts and attention on them in an attempt to get them to go along with a fake terror plot instigated and planned by the RCMP. The court decision confirmed that the threat came only from the RCMP, who conceived it and provided all of the means to carry it out (the supposed bomb had no detonator), and who manipulated the reluctant and confused couple to go along, even as they offered resistance, for fear of losing the newfound benefits being provided by the RCMP (in meals, companionship, etc.).</p>
<p>Given this context the real, and fundamental, question is why anyone should trust and accept the RCMP version of events. This case has the markings of distortion and deception that mark other so-called anti-terror investigations in the Canadian state context from the Germinal Collective case (even before 9/11) to “Project Thread,” through the “Toronto 18,” to the entrapment of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody. In the Germinal Collective, “Toronto 18” and Nuttall and Korody cases in particular, the police were actively, centrally, involved in the instigating, planning, encouraging, and operationalizing of terror acts that were never carried out (and never would have been in the absence of police). As Shantz (2016) writes, these cases are primarily designed and carried out to give the police justification for continued or expanded resources and to stoke social fear, social phobias (particularly Islamophobia, fear of migrants, and fear of poor people).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of Aaron Driver</p>
<p>The killing of Aron Driver by RCMP officers apparently began with a tip from the FBI that a person in Canada was possibly planning to carry out a terrorist attack. There have also been reports that the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which operates the city’s subway, buses, and trolley cars, received a threat against the transit system. In response to the FBI tip, details of which are not known, the RCMP descended upon the home of Aaron Driver, a young man who had been arrested and released on an anti-terror peace bond for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS as acts of self-defense in a time of war. Driver had not been observed or charged for engaging in any activities related to terrorism. He had been targeted solely for his ideas and social media presence.</p>
<p>On the surface the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver, if one is to believe events as the police describe them, is fairly straightforward. On Wednesday, August 10, 2016, the federal RCMP converged on the house in which Aaron Driver was living in the community of Strathroy, a small city of around 20,000 people in southwestern Ontario. Sometime after 4:00 PM police observed Driver leave his residence and enter a taxi waiting in his driveway. Police report that shortly thereafter, as police approached the vehicle, Driver detonated an explosive device injuring himself and causing minor injuries to the taxi operator. The police also claim seeing a second device and responding by shooting Driver, killing him.</p>
<p>So far all of the details provided have come only from the RCMP who have been the only ones to claim to be witnesses to these events. Yet why should we believe the RCMP account? And what sorts of questions need to be asked about it? A closer look at the Driver case leaves many questions hanging in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punishing Bad Thoughts: The Aaron Driver Case</p>
<p>Of note, Driver had been initially targeted for punishment by police not for any suspected actions but simply for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS in online venues. That is, the police targeting of Aaron Driver was an early effort by the state to criminalize people simply for expressing “bad thoughts”—a repressive policy approach, in violation of civil and human rights, which Conservative and Liberal governments alike have pursued and sought to expand in the Canadian context (on the policing of bad thoughts see Shantz 2014).</p>
<p>Aaron Driver had come to the attention of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in October of 2014 when he was reported to be tweeting support for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria under the online name of Harun Abdurahman. Driver had also justified the 2014 attack on a ceremonial officer at Ottawa’s War Memorial and run to Parliament Hill (seat of federal government) by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, as a military response to Canadian military actions in Iraq and Syria. For this Driver was arrested and brought before the court in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Driver was released on an anti-terror peace bond. Under its terms he was not allowed to associate with any terrorist organization and was under prohibitions against using a computer or cellphone. Driver was also required to live at a specified address in Strathroy, Ontario and to notify a specified RCMP sergeant should there be any changes in his address (Canadian Press 2016).</p>
<p>The peace bond allows for intermediate constraints on a person’s liberty on the basis of evidence that would not be sufficient to prove an actual terrorism offence (Forcese 2016). As one can see there are real spaces for abuse and unjust application with such an instrument. Indeed the court is unlikely to turn down any request by the federal government to apply an anti-terror peace bond.</p>
<p>And recall that John Nuttall and Amanda Korody, who had spent three years incarcerated under what was nothing other than an RCMP entrapment scheme, were re-arrested mere hours after being released following the finding of entrapment. That was clearly a punitive (and mean-spirited) attempt by the government, and RCMP, to save some face or recoup some losses.</p>
<p>After Driver&#8217;s killing his former lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, stated publicly that there was no evidence that the young man was in any way directly affiliated with ISIS or with any other supposed terrorist organization (Canadian Press 2016). He found the claims of police against Driver to not fit with the man’s character as he knew him. According to Tailleur: “It’s shocking. Absolutely shocking, actually. He was generally looked to be low risk as long as there&#8217;s certain things that had been dealt with” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016)</p>
<p>Tailleur suggested that the killing of Aaron Driver raises some significant questions. He notes that Driver was almost certainly under regular police surveillance (Canadian Press 2016). In Tailleur’s words: “If he was doing his thing, it was kind of ridiculous because I&#8217;m certain he was going to be under scrutiny beyond his peace bond. Police would always monitor his whereabouts &#8230; They&#8217;d make him a priority” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016). So how could he compile materials and instructions to construct two bombs? How could he leave his house with the two bombs in hand? Why was he not stopped before entering a cab and putting a cabbie at risk?</p>
<p>Even from a liberal perspective many questions arise from the killing of Aaron Driver. Legal scholar Craig Forcese outlines some of these:</p>
<p>“How did someone known to authorities and subject to a peace bond get as far as posing a credible (and perhaps actual) suicide bomb threat?</p>
<p>“Why was the police intervention 11th hour, in the nick of time (and perhaps after it, given that there was a reported explosion causing injury)?</p>
<p>“Given the presence of a weapon and that there was apparently a computer video involved, Driver was in clear violation of his peace bond terms (and so basically automatically subject to imprisonment for up to 4 years). So why was there no arrest much earlier?</p>
<p>“Why was there no public warning?</p>
<p>“All of this is to say: Where was the early detection? Was this a resource issue? Did something go missing? Will be discussing a failure to ‘connect the dots’?” (Forcese 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this leads inexorably to the question: “Was the Aaron Driver killing part of yet another entrapment case, like Germinal and like Nuttall and Korody, which somehow went too far or took an unforeseen turn?” Or: “Was it a dangerous game of chicken in which the RCMP miscalculated?” Regardless of one’s view on the matter of this killing by police, it is clear that answers will not be provided by RCMP or CSIS accounts alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Comes of It: Fear Politics and Continuing Repression</p>
<p>To properly understand the real impact and consequences of the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver socially we need only look to current debates over anti-terror laws, particularly the controversial and widely unpopular Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as Bill C-51) initiated by the then-ruling Conservative government prior to the 2016 election, and the recent rebuke of RCMP practices in the Nuttall-Korody decision. This includes a call that emerged immediately in response to the Driver killing to review, and stiffen, terror related peace bonds, the same control mechanisms notably that the government seeks to impose on Nuttall and Korody and for which cause they were re-arrested shortly after their release following the entrapment decision. After the Driver killing the calls are to make the peace bonds even more restrictive and punitive.</p>
<p>The Driver killing comes as critics have been calling for the Liberal government to finally follow through on their election promise, prominent during the campaign, to revise C-51. Now the discussions of possible C-51 revisions will be shadowed by the Driver case and its use by security forces and politicians alike to defend the legislation and perhaps even build upon it.</p>
<p>The cynic will certainly note that on two other occasions in which C-51 and anti-terror laws were set to be debated in federal parliament the discussions were inflamed by highly visible so-called acts of terrorism. Perhaps ironically, the most recent one included the shooting of Canadian Forces soldier Nathan Cirillo by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the online justification of which brought river to the attention of the security apparatus in the first place. It might be noted that, in terms of definitions of terrorism, Zehaf-Bibeau only sought military and government targets and did not target or harm civilians even as he had ample opportunity to do so during his adventure in busy downtown Ottawa.</p>
<p>The reactionary Conservative Party of Canada, authors and shepherds of C-51, have already made this connection of the Driver case to the maintenance of intrusive anti-terror laws explicit. In the words of the Conservative Party’s interim leader Rona Ambrose the morning after Driver was killed:</p>
<p>“I salute and thank the law enforcement and intelligence officers who put their own lives on the line to stop this potential attack on innocent Canadians. Unfortunately, the Liberal government campaigned on a promise to strip these officers of some of the essential investigative and enforcement tools to do this work, which the previous Conservative government provided through Bill C-51, and which have already been wisely used to disrupt terrorist activities nearly two dozen times since last fall. I call on the Liberal government to ensure all of Canada&#8217;s security and intelligence services keep the tools they need to do their jobs.” (quoted in Wherry 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous concerns were raised by a broad cross section of the public in Canada immediately upon the announcement of Bill C-51. Concerns were raised that provisions in the legislation criminalize acts of civil disobedience, such as a protest or demonstration because these could be viewed as “unlawful” (in the absence of a permit, or in cases of trespassing, or marches in roadways). Other essential activities, such as a workplace strike or occupation or boycott could be viewed as terrorist acts on the basis that they impact economic structures or practices. Worries have also been stated about provisions that allow for the punishing of bad thoughts or propaganda rather than actual activities related to terrorist acts.</p>
<p>During the federal election of 2015 the Liberal Party, then seeking to succeed the Conservatives as ruling party, promised legislation that would address key concerns within C-51. Yet approaching a year later after taking power the Liberals have still not tabled even proposals on how they might transform C-51, leaving some critics to believe that the election promises were simply appeals for votes on the basis of countering widely unpopular legislation (which seemed emblematic of the authoritarian and repressive Conservative Party approach). The Liberal government has said in general terms that any new legislation would: “guarantee that all Canadian Security Intelligence Service warrants respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; ensure that Canadians are not limited from lawful protests and advocacy; narrow overly broad definitions, such as defining ‘terrorist propaganda’ more clearly;” as well as “limit Communications Security Establishment&#8217;s powers by requiring a warrant to engage in the surveillance of Canadians” (quoted in Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>At the same time there is nothing to suggest, despite the intimations of the Conservative Party and their leader Rona Ambrose, that C-51 provisions played or could have played any part in a case like that of Aaron Driver. The RCMP supposedly acted on the basis of a tip coming not from their own surveillance or intelligence but rather from the FBI. In addition Driver was already subject to a terror peace bond which have been in operation since before C-51 took effect. Notably Driver’s legal team mounted a successful challenge which resulted in a Manitoba judge ruling against the provision in C-51 that allowed the courts to mandate religious counselling for an individual on a peace bond (Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>Another line of pursuit for repressive forces in the Canadian context involves calling into question the anti-terror peace bond, not on grounds that it threatens civil liberties and is too broad, but on obverse grounds that it is too lenient. On one hand there are calls for imprisonment of people simply on the basis of the low threshold evidence used in securing the peace bond. This would mean criminalizing bad thoughts, which, in fact, many police and politicians desire anyway. As law professor Craig Forcese suggests: “Incarceration depends, however, on a crime. And our terrorism criminal law already sets the tripwire for terrorism crime very far from actual acts of violence. (None of the two dozen or so persons in prison for post-9/11 terrorism crimes got further than plotting before they were charged and convicted)” (2016). Calls for incarceration on the low level of evidence provided for a peace bond will put many people in prison who pose no material threat to anyone (except perhaps to themselves). It will, however, give an opportunity for expansion of the security, surveillance, and policing apparatus as well as the prison-industrial complex, which is precisely what many police agencies and politicians alike desire.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some hawks will call for greater integration of security and intelligence services. This will include not only calls for tighter integration or greater communication and information transfer between agencies within the Canadian state (among local police forces, the RCMP, CSIS, perhaps the military). It will also include calls for greater integration and/or communication between the Canadian agencies and external agencies like the FBI or MI5. This will be highlighted especially given the apparently lead and crucial role played by the FBI in the Driver affair. Indeed even liberal critics like Forcese have been quick to proclaim that coordination between police and CSIS, as in the Driver case “is welcome” (proclaiming even before all the facts are known that “the system worked” in this case) (see Forcese 2016).</p>
<p>Menacingly the Liberal government has suggested a focus on counter-radicalization strategies. While they have provided not even general notions of what this might entail there are examples from other liberal democracies that open ominous possibilities, including the case in the UK in which legislation requires post-secondary faculty to report to police instances in which students appear to be radicalizing. Notably some have used the Driver example to argue that the so-called religious therapy provision in anti-terror peace bonds, deemed “deprogramming” by the court and struck down, should have been upheld and should now be imposed in future cases.</p>
<p>Following the Aaron Driver killing the Liberal government is clearly open to additions to the apparatus as part of the C-51 discussions. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, addressing questions after the Driver killing said the government will now “consult Canadians about what else they want to see in their national security framework” (quoted in Wherry 2016). What else indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In all of this the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver provides another example of the political production of fear for purposes of state, particularly police, expansion. It provides another opportunity for the dramatization of evil by state authorities at various levels. This can in turn be used to shore up or develop new mechanisms of surveillance, criminalization, and punishment. It can be used to reinforce legislation, like C-51, that faces criticism and possible revision. It can provide the impetus for new, more repressive, legislation. It can be used to increase the flow of resources to agencies like the RCMP. In addition such moments of manipulable terror panic can be used to spread policing practices into other sectors. Such is the case in legislation, as in the UK that seeks to turn professors into spies, snitches, or cops.</p>
<p>All of this must be resisted. Police must always be challenged and countered on their exclusive descriptions of events (and monopoly on knowledge about the circumstances of such cases). Police accounts should never be accepted at face value. There must also be public mobilizations against any and all attempts to expand the security state apparatus. Furthermore, public manipulation of terror panics must be called out and attempts by state and media actors to manufacture social phobias confronted.</p>

       *<p>The killing of Aaron Driver by RCMP on August 10, 2016, in what police have claimed was an anti-terrorism sting has raised a number of serious questions about the nature of the RCMP operation, the police relationship with Driver beforehand, the timing of the police intervention, and the seriousness of the threat, if any, actually posed by Driver. The only information circulating publicly is based on the word of the police and the lone known witness the cabbie, Terry Duffield, called by Driver before the police ambush and in whose taxi Driver was killed by an RCMP bullet.</p>
<p>RCMP claim to have intervened against Driver on the basis of a tip by the FBI that someone in Canada was planning an imminent terrorist attack in a public space. Yet their actions in approaching and killing Driver call into question the response taken to what police are claiming was a real, imminent, threat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Manner of Terror Bomb Explodes Killing No One?</p>
<p>Police initially intimated that Aaron Driver had been killed by a bomb that he held and which he detonated upon seeing police approach the cab he was sitting in. Yet an autopsy released by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), who are investigating the actions of the RCMP has apparently revealed that Driver was killed by police bullets. The autopsy showed that several police bullets struck Driver, piercing vital organs (Rieti 2016).</p>
<p>Aaron Driver’s father, Wayne Driver, reported that his son was killed by a police bullet that struck his heart. The supposed bomb he carried could not have killed him. According to Wayne Driver:  “It was the police officer’s bullet that killed him. The bomb that exploded he could have walked away from with minor to severe injuries they said” (quoted in Bell 2016a).</p>
<p>According to police Driver was even allowed to leave the vehicle after the explosion. In the words of RCMP Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana: “Subsequent to that he came out of the cab and was standing up and was not following the direction that was provided” (quoted in Bell 2016b). And police had no opportunity to act before then given the imminent peril they claim?</p>
<p>This raises one rather large, fundamental, question. How could a bomb that was supposed to pose an imminent threat to broad public safety not be powerful enough to kill even the single person holding it on his lap? Now it is possible that Driver simply messed up in making it. It is also possible, especially given questions raised below about the police actions and the timing of their intervention that they had some knowledge of the bomb beforehand and had reason to expect that the bomb would do little or no harm. Perhaps because police had designed it and helped prepare it, as a dud, in much the manner they did for John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in entrapping that unfortunate couple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Danger to Whom?: Why Not Protect the Cabbie?</p>
<p>The Strathroy, Ontario, taxi driver in whose cab Aaron Driver was shot and killed would certainly like to know why the police did not act sooner to protect him and to intercept the supposed terrorist before he entered the taxi carrying what RCMP have claimed were two bombs. RCMP officers already had Driver’s home surrounded when Terry Duffield drove his taxi cab into the driveway around 4:30 PM. According to police they swarmed the cab within seconds of Driver entering the back seat. Police claim that with the approach of police Driver detonated one explosive. RCMP claim that it was only in response to that detonation that they shot and killed Driver. In addition to the questions about the nature of a bomb, and its potential to cause mass harm, which could detonate in someone’s lap and not even kill that person directly, there is the question about why police waited, if they really believed Driver carried a serious bomb that posed substantial threat, until he was inside a car with an innocent bystander before approaching him. Why would they give him a chance to detonate the supposed bomb or bombs at all?</p>
<p>For his part Terry Duffield is furious with how police acted, risking his life if their account is true, and is promising legal action against the force. Duffield claims he is still dealing with the shock of that morning’s events and is taking medications for the resulting back pain and stress. In his words: “There will be legal action taken on this. They put my life in jeopardy” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Duffield, like many observers, is perplexed, to say the least, that police, if they really believed they were dealing with a terrorist carrying explosives and out to launch an “imminent attack,” would not stop the suspect before he put a bystander’s (the public’s) life in danger.</p>
<p>In Duffield’s view, police could have and should have done more to protect him than they did. In his words:</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think police handled it very well at all. They did absolutely nothing to help me. At no time did they try to warn me. At no time did they try to stop my vehicle from entering the address…This gentleman was allowed to walk in front of my car, down the side of my car, get in my car and all of these sharp-shooters, all these SWAT teams and all these people who were supposed to be around, nobody did anything until after the bomb went off.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>This raises real, significant, questions. It makes the critic wonder if police had reason to believe that Driver’s bomb was a phony, incapable of exploding, much like the one that RCMP helped to build for John Nuttall and Amada Korody in their infamous entrapment case of two poor, marginalized, people dealing with addition and mental health issues in Surrey, British Columbia three years before the river case. Perhaps police believed the bomb was no bomb at all (because they had assisted in or directed its’ making). Perhaps the cabbie was part of the public anti-terror takedown gone wrong (there is no evidence of this at this point and Duffield would seem sincere in his claims). In initial reports it was said that Duffield jumped from the taxi before the bomb was detonated. More recent reports (CBC News 2016) say that police ordered him to leave the car after the bomb had already been detonated.</p>
<p>Duffield had a follow up interview with police and specifically asked why the force did not offer him any protection in their operation that morning. The cabbie remains dissatisfied that police offered him no explanation. The public seeks one as well. Duffield, who has retained a lawyer and intends to pursue legal action, and curious observers alike, are left to ponder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining Secrecy and Unaccountability in Anti-Terror Cases: No Independent Investigation</p>
<p>Confounding all of this is the fact that there has been, and there will be, no independent public investigation into the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver and any or all of the questionable circumstances surrounding it. Provincial police have been tasked with the investigation into Driver&#8217;s shooting at the request of the Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service (Rieti 2016). The OPP and Strathroy-Caradoc police “continue to jointly investigate the incident” under direction of the head of the OPP’s criminal investigations branch. That is, the police, and only the police, are “investigating” the police in this case. That has been a consistent recipe for cover up, hush up, distortion, and distraction. And legitimation.</p>
<p>All of this is in keeping with the secrecy, lack of transparency, obfuscation, and disassembly that have been the hallmarks of anti-terror practices in Canada. This includes the secretive actions of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Communications Security Establishment Canada (Canada’s NSA) as well as notorious instruments like security certificates which violate all notions of due process and allow for the state to detain people for indefinite periods while subjecting then to “trials” without disclosure or even a reading of charges against them, ad without proper representation or defense.</p>

       *<p>The shooting and killing of Aaron Driver (24) by RCMP in Strathroy, Ontario on August 10, 2016 has, as expected, served as a launching point for a variety of government trial balloons on increasing and expanding repressive state policies and practices under the panic conditions of publicly stoked fear over domestic terrorism within Canada. Some of the early proposals from the government may suggest to the concerned observer the manifestation of a sequence on re-education or de-programing from <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. In any event it is clear that the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has served the function (perhaps intentional from the point of view of the state) of providing the necessary cover to bring forward a new regimen of repressive anti-terror governance and social regulation. Even as more questions are being raised by the circumstances of someone being killed for planning a terror attack despite the fact that the bomb he supposedly detonated on his lap was not strong enough to kill even himself (as this week’s coroner’s report showed Driver was killed by a police bullet as he was shot twice by police) (Ballingall 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear Politics and New Regimes of Repression in Canada</p>
<p>The police operation that ended in the killing of Driver was carried out within a specific context of growing calls for review, revision, or repeal of the Canadian government’s controversial and widely opposed Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as C-51). The timing of the Driver killing, in a period of public review and criticism of anti-terror legislation is not unique. Indeed previous recent cases, such as the police shooting of supposed “lone wolf” Michael Zehaf-Bibeau at Parliament Hill in 2014 and the announcement of the arrests of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in 2013 (in a case since ruled in court to be entirely police entrapment), occurred within a context of discussion over the Canadian state’s anti-terrorism regime and policies.</p>
<p>Jeff Shantz and Hisham Ramadan (2016) have outlined the political mechanisms by which fear is converted to repressive policy, particularly within the context of even events associated, even falsely, with (imagined) terrorism. Their discussions detail and explain the manipulation of state involved “terror plots” and the public discussion of responses (by police, courts, government) to them in dramatizing the need for more repressive regimes to address supposed “home grown terrorism.”</p>
<p>Only a week after the RCMP shot Aaron Driver, a young man already processed through the courts and released on an anti-terror peace bond restricting his movements and access to cell phones and the internet, and the federal Liberal government is already, again as expected, making noises about new repressive policies which would allow for increased surveillance as well as intrusive measures to control people’s “bad thoughts.”</p>
<p>In a presentation to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Ottawa, on August 17, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale revealed that the federal government is looking to make so-called counter-radicalization counselling mandatory for anyone under an anti-terrorism peace bonds. Notably, this provision has been part of C-51 but was struck down by a Winnipeg judge in the case involving Aaron Driver.</p>
<p>Goodale has insisted that a federal consultation on national security must be undertaken and he expects it to conclude by the end of 2016. Notably, Goodale has positioned this consultation as a means to innovate new repressive and intrusive measures rather than as a mechanism of ratcheting down anti-terror policies and procedures (such as ending security certificates which have been used to hold racialized, migrants under vague government claims of some association with terrorism, under conditions that violate due process or by abolishing the anti-terror list which is used to criminalize resistance movements that oppose ally states of the Canadian government).</p>
<p>Tellingly the Liberal government is using the police killing of Aaron Driver to openly promote the idea of counter-radicalization, which, in fact, they had raised before the Driver shooting and which had, at that time, raised obvious red flags for critics.  The federal government actually views the establishment of a federal office of counter-radicalization as a centerpiece of their anti-terror regime. The office of counter-radicalization would serve as “a national focal point for research, counselling and intervention services” (Bronskill 2016a). Goodale, in speaking to the chiefs of police re-stated the government’s prioritization of this center for controlling “bad thoughts” and re-education. And despite Goodale’s simultaneous claim that consultation and reflection are key to the government approach going forward he unapologetically presents this initiative as one that must happen without public consulation or review before the end of this summer. According to Goodale: “We are in the process of recruiting the person that will lead the effort. And we are determined to get this office up and running toward the end of the summer, the beginning of the fall. The incident is Strathroy demonstrates how very important this priority is” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Note that the police killing of Aaron Driver is openly asserted as the impetus for rushing the “bad thoughts” center into existence. Interestingly Goodale acknowledged that there had been efforts to de-radicalized or counsel Driver but they had not been systematic.</p>
<p>Goodale again referenced the Aaron Driver case, and what he supposedly represents, in justifying the de-radicalization, re-education center. According to Goodale, the government views as among its greatest security concerns the so-called “lone wolves” who are drawn to “extreme ideologies (Bronskill 2016a). In his words: “We need to understand what positive messages can counteract the insidious poison that draws people in, especially young people (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). No word from Goodale what the positive messages involve but one might guess from Liberal government practice they should include the benefits of war in Iraq and Syria and the selling of arms to the brutal terror regime in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale has also raised the prospect of putting people released on peace bonds under constant surveillance. He noted that Driver was not under constant surveillance, something the RCMP bemoan. According to Goodale:  “That is obviously a lesson that one needs to look at very carefully, as a result of the incident in Strathroy. And we are examining very carefully what we need to do to make our police and security activity more effective” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Again, we should remember that peace bonds can be and are placed on people under virtually no evidence at a threshold much lower than would ever lead to successful prosecution. So the real result of the government proposal would be to allow constant surveillance of people who show no or minimal signs of actually engaging in a terrorist act. Such would have been contentious to say the least before the killing of Aaron Driver. It is now a supposed necessity, a lesson learned from that case. Goodale refused to comment on whether surveillance has in fact been stepped up for the dozen or so people who are currently under anti-terrorism peace bonds (Bronskill 2016a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn Over Your Password: Invasive Policing and the Terror Panic</p>
<p>Minister Goodale was not prepared to stop there however and has raised the prospect of giving police what they want in terms of invasive policing. In his meeting with the chiefs of police Goodale also gave notice that Canadians “need to think about how far police should be allowed to go in accessing their electronic devices and communications” (Bronskill, 2016b). Indeed, following the Driver killing, the government is going to use the occasion of a federal review of cybersecurity to discuss a proposal prepared by the country’s police chiefs for a new law that would compel people to reveal their passwords with the court’s consent (Bronskill 2016b).</p>
<p>At his meeting with police chiefs, Goodale “acknowledged that smartphones contain a wealth of personal data and can reveal much more about a person than an ordinary physical search might” (Bronskill 2016b). While conceding that people do value their privacy, Goodale also suggested that people would be willing to compromise that concern in order to give police more tools, particularly to pursue terror related activities. According to Goodale: “I think Canadians recognize the imperatives on both sides” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b). Yet this is not a matter of weighing equivalences. Either police have access to deeply personal private information or they do not. And one must always ask under what circumstances they gain access. Again, connecting this access to a peace bond would be connecting it to potentially nothing in terms of real evidence or legitimate concern. Civil liberties groups and privacy critics have suggested that such legislation would be unconstitutional (something that has certainly never deterred police chiefs or their supporters in government).</p>
<p>While the public has shown no desire for such legislation or interest in debating it, Goodale is using the Driver case to suggest that debate on this policy is now needed. According to Goodale:</p>
<p>“This is a critically important subject area, and one that — for one reason or another — has not been subject to adequate public discussion. I think over the course of the fall, it will. And that will help us as a government and it will also help police forces and security agencies to define the parameters.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that there has been much public opposition to similar proposals from the former ruling Conservative government. He RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has changed the terrain of operations for the Liberal government. How fortuitous indeed.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale also used the occasion to raise the panic figure of the lone wolf in a basement. In his words:</p>
<p>“The hackers and scammers who are constantly trying to break into our information systems are a motley but potent combination of foreign states, militaries, terror groups, organized crime, petty thieves and vandals, and even that lonely computer geek in his underwear in the basement.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodale also noted that this is also a real opportunity for investment or profit for small and large firms alike. Again this is a further convergence in the anti-terror trajectory of neoliberal accumulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>All of these utterances, musings, and proposals for repressive and invasive state policies and practices have been presented within the space of only a single week following the police killing of Aaron Driver. For those of us observing and commenting on government anti-terror regimes, fear politics, and state regulatory frameworks more broadly such moves by the government after the Driver killing were, far from being surprising, actually expected at least generally if not in these specifics (see Shantz 2016).</p>
<p>In this the police killing of Aaron Driver, within the context of an as yet unconfirmed attempt at terrorism, stands with other cases such as the Germinal collective set up in 2001, the Zehaf-Bibeau killing, and the Nuttall and Korody entrapment. We should expect that further, more extensive, invasive, and punitive policies and practices will emerge and be brought forward under the guise of public consultation (framed and shadowed by the Aaron Driver case). Such is the position of the killing of Aaron Driver within the manufacture of social phobias and fear in the current social and political context within the Canadian state (a state that is, remember, active in war).</p>

       *<p>Serious questions need to be asked in the wake of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) killing of supposed terror suspect Aaron Driver (24), shot by RCMP officers on August 10 following an apparent tip from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). RCMP claim Driver detonated an explosive device in a cab and that he was killed because he had access to another device.  Among the questions that require answers are how someone who was on a terror peace bond which restricted his actions and access to the internet could compile information and materials to build a bomb and build it under such conditions. It must also be answered why someone under watch by RCMP as a terror suspect was able to leave his house with two supposed bombs with no intervention beforehand (and after the supposed tip was received).</p>
<p>These questions, and questions about RCMP anti-terror operations more broadly, are particularly pressing given that the killing of Driver comes within a month of a major court decision finding that the RCMP had entrapped two poor people, dealing with mental health and addiction issues, in a phony police created and directed “terror threat.” In that case the RCMP spent millions of dollars in labor and resource to target and prime two poor residents of Surrey, B.C., John Nutall and Amanda Korody, lavishing gifts and attention on them in an attempt to get them to go along with a fake terror plot instigated and planned by the RCMP. The court decision confirmed that the threat came only from the RCMP, who conceived it and provided all of the means to carry it out (the supposed bomb had no detonator), and who manipulated the reluctant and confused couple to go along, even as they offered resistance, for fear of losing the newfound benefits being provided by the RCMP (in meals, companionship, etc.).</p>
<p>Given this context the real, and fundamental, question is why anyone should trust and accept the RCMP version of events. This case has the markings of distortion and deception that mark other so-called anti-terror investigations in the Canadian state context from the Germinal Collective case (even before 9/11) to “Project Thread,” through the “Toronto 18,” to the entrapment of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody. In the Germinal Collective, “Toronto 18” and Nuttall and Korody cases in particular, the police were actively, centrally, involved in the instigating, planning, encouraging, and operationalizing of terror acts that were never carried out (and never would have been in the absence of police). As Shantz (2016) writes, these cases are primarily designed and carried out to give the police justification for continued or expanded resources and to stoke social fear, social phobias (particularly Islamophobia, fear of migrants, and fear of poor people).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of Aaron Driver</p>
<p>The killing of Aron Driver by RCMP officers apparently began with a tip from the FBI that a person in Canada was possibly planning to carry out a terrorist attack. There have also been reports that the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which operates the city’s subway, buses, and trolley cars, received a threat against the transit system. In response to the FBI tip, details of which are not known, the RCMP descended upon the home of Aaron Driver, a young man who had been arrested and released on an anti-terror peace bond for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS as acts of self-defense in a time of war. Driver had not been observed or charged for engaging in any activities related to terrorism. He had been targeted solely for his ideas and social media presence.</p>
<p>On the surface the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver, if one is to believe events as the police describe them, is fairly straightforward. On Wednesday, August 10, 2016, the federal RCMP converged on the house in which Aaron Driver was living in the community of Strathroy, a small city of around 20,000 people in southwestern Ontario. Sometime after 4:00 PM police observed Driver leave his residence and enter a taxi waiting in his driveway. Police report that shortly thereafter, as police approached the vehicle, Driver detonated an explosive device injuring himself and causing minor injuries to the taxi operator. The police also claim seeing a second device and responding by shooting Driver, killing him.</p>
<p>So far all of the details provided have come only from the RCMP who have been the only ones to claim to be witnesses to these events. Yet why should we believe the RCMP account? And what sorts of questions need to be asked about it? A closer look at the Driver case leaves many questions hanging in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punishing Bad Thoughts: The Aaron Driver Case</p>
<p>Of note, Driver had been initially targeted for punishment by police not for any suspected actions but simply for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS in online venues. That is, the police targeting of Aaron Driver was an early effort by the state to criminalize people simply for expressing “bad thoughts”—a repressive policy approach, in violation of civil and human rights, which Conservative and Liberal governments alike have pursued and sought to expand in the Canadian context (on the policing of bad thoughts see Shantz 2014).</p>
<p>Aaron Driver had come to the attention of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in October of 2014 when he was reported to be tweeting support for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria under the online name of Harun Abdurahman. Driver had also justified the 2014 attack on a ceremonial officer at Ottawa’s War Memorial and run to Parliament Hill (seat of federal government) by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, as a military response to Canadian military actions in Iraq and Syria. For this Driver was arrested and brought before the court in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Driver was released on an anti-terror peace bond. Under its terms he was not allowed to associate with any terrorist organization and was under prohibitions against using a computer or cellphone. Driver was also required to live at a specified address in Strathroy, Ontario and to notify a specified RCMP sergeant should there be any changes in his address (Canadian Press 2016).</p>
<p>The peace bond allows for intermediate constraints on a person’s liberty on the basis of evidence that would not be sufficient to prove an actual terrorism offence (Forcese 2016). As one can see there are real spaces for abuse and unjust application with such an instrument. Indeed the court is unlikely to turn down any request by the federal government to apply an anti-terror peace bond.</p>
<p>And recall that John Nuttall and Amanda Korody, who had spent three years incarcerated under what was nothing other than an RCMP entrapment scheme, were re-arrested mere hours after being released following the finding of entrapment. That was clearly a punitive (and mean-spirited) attempt by the government, and RCMP, to save some face or recoup some losses.</p>
<p>After Driver&#8217;s killing his former lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, stated publicly that there was no evidence that the young man was in any way directly affiliated with ISIS or with any other supposed terrorist organization (Canadian Press 2016). He found the claims of police against Driver to not fit with the man’s character as he knew him. According to Tailleur: “It’s shocking. Absolutely shocking, actually. He was generally looked to be low risk as long as there&#8217;s certain things that had been dealt with” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016)</p>
<p>Tailleur suggested that the killing of Aaron Driver raises some significant questions. He notes that Driver was almost certainly under regular police surveillance (Canadian Press 2016). In Tailleur’s words: “If he was doing his thing, it was kind of ridiculous because I&#8217;m certain he was going to be under scrutiny beyond his peace bond. Police would always monitor his whereabouts &#8230; They&#8217;d make him a priority” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016). So how could he compile materials and instructions to construct two bombs? How could he leave his house with the two bombs in hand? Why was he not stopped before entering a cab and putting a cabbie at risk?</p>
<p>Even from a liberal perspective many questions arise from the killing of Aaron Driver. Legal scholar Craig Forcese outlines some of these:</p>
<p>“How did someone known to authorities and subject to a peace bond get as far as posing a credible (and perhaps actual) suicide bomb threat?</p>
<p>“Why was the police intervention 11th hour, in the nick of time (and perhaps after it, given that there was a reported explosion causing injury)?</p>
<p>“Given the presence of a weapon and that there was apparently a computer video involved, Driver was in clear violation of his peace bond terms (and so basically automatically subject to imprisonment for up to 4 years). So why was there no arrest much earlier?</p>
<p>“Why was there no public warning?</p>
<p>“All of this is to say: Where was the early detection? Was this a resource issue? Did something go missing? Will be discussing a failure to ‘connect the dots’?” (Forcese 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this leads inexorably to the question: “Was the Aaron Driver killing part of yet another entrapment case, like Germinal and like Nuttall and Korody, which somehow went too far or took an unforeseen turn?” Or: “Was it a dangerous game of chicken in which the RCMP miscalculated?” Regardless of one’s view on the matter of this killing by police, it is clear that answers will not be provided by RCMP or CSIS accounts alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Comes of It: Fear Politics and Continuing Repression</p>
<p>To properly understand the real impact and consequences of the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver socially we need only look to current debates over anti-terror laws, particularly the controversial and widely unpopular Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as Bill C-51) initiated by the then-ruling Conservative government prior to the 2016 election, and the recent rebuke of RCMP practices in the Nuttall-Korody decision. This includes a call that emerged immediately in response to the Driver killing to review, and stiffen, terror related peace bonds, the same control mechanisms notably that the government seeks to impose on Nuttall and Korody and for which cause they were re-arrested shortly after their release following the entrapment decision. After the Driver killing the calls are to make the peace bonds even more restrictive and punitive.</p>
<p>The Driver killing comes as critics have been calling for the Liberal government to finally follow through on their election promise, prominent during the campaign, to revise C-51. Now the discussions of possible C-51 revisions will be shadowed by the Driver case and its use by security forces and politicians alike to defend the legislation and perhaps even build upon it.</p>
<p>The cynic will certainly note that on two other occasions in which C-51 and anti-terror laws were set to be debated in federal parliament the discussions were inflamed by highly visible so-called acts of terrorism. Perhaps ironically, the most recent one included the shooting of Canadian Forces soldier Nathan Cirillo by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the online justification of which brought river to the attention of the security apparatus in the first place. It might be noted that, in terms of definitions of terrorism, Zehaf-Bibeau only sought military and government targets and did not target or harm civilians even as he had ample opportunity to do so during his adventure in busy downtown Ottawa.</p>
<p>The reactionary Conservative Party of Canada, authors and shepherds of C-51, have already made this connection of the Driver case to the maintenance of intrusive anti-terror laws explicit. In the words of the Conservative Party’s interim leader Rona Ambrose the morning after Driver was killed:</p>
<p>“I salute and thank the law enforcement and intelligence officers who put their own lives on the line to stop this potential attack on innocent Canadians. Unfortunately, the Liberal government campaigned on a promise to strip these officers of some of the essential investigative and enforcement tools to do this work, which the previous Conservative government provided through Bill C-51, and which have already been wisely used to disrupt terrorist activities nearly two dozen times since last fall. I call on the Liberal government to ensure all of Canada&#8217;s security and intelligence services keep the tools they need to do their jobs.” (quoted in Wherry 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous concerns were raised by a broad cross section of the public in Canada immediately upon the announcement of Bill C-51. Concerns were raised that provisions in the legislation criminalize acts of civil disobedience, such as a protest or demonstration because these could be viewed as “unlawful” (in the absence of a permit, or in cases of trespassing, or marches in roadways). Other essential activities, such as a workplace strike or occupation or boycott could be viewed as terrorist acts on the basis that they impact economic structures or practices. Worries have also been stated about provisions that allow for the punishing of bad thoughts or propaganda rather than actual activities related to terrorist acts.</p>
<p>During the federal election of 2015 the Liberal Party, then seeking to succeed the Conservatives as ruling party, promised legislation that would address key concerns within C-51. Yet approaching a year later after taking power the Liberals have still not tabled even proposals on how they might transform C-51, leaving some critics to believe that the election promises were simply appeals for votes on the basis of countering widely unpopular legislation (which seemed emblematic of the authoritarian and repressive Conservative Party approach). The Liberal government has said in general terms that any new legislation would: “guarantee that all Canadian Security Intelligence Service warrants respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; ensure that Canadians are not limited from lawful protests and advocacy; narrow overly broad definitions, such as defining ‘terrorist propaganda’ more clearly;” as well as “limit Communications Security Establishment&#8217;s powers by requiring a warrant to engage in the surveillance of Canadians” (quoted in Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>At the same time there is nothing to suggest, despite the intimations of the Conservative Party and their leader Rona Ambrose, that C-51 provisions played or could have played any part in a case like that of Aaron Driver. The RCMP supposedly acted on the basis of a tip coming not from their own surveillance or intelligence but rather from the FBI. In addition Driver was already subject to a terror peace bond which have been in operation since before C-51 took effect. Notably Driver’s legal team mounted a successful challenge which resulted in a Manitoba judge ruling against the provision in C-51 that allowed the courts to mandate religious counselling for an individual on a peace bond (Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>Another line of pursuit for repressive forces in the Canadian context involves calling into question the anti-terror peace bond, not on grounds that it threatens civil liberties and is too broad, but on obverse grounds that it is too lenient. On one hand there are calls for imprisonment of people simply on the basis of the low threshold evidence used in securing the peace bond. This would mean criminalizing bad thoughts, which, in fact, many police and politicians desire anyway. As law professor Craig Forcese suggests: “Incarceration depends, however, on a crime. And our terrorism criminal law already sets the tripwire for terrorism crime very far from actual acts of violence. (None of the two dozen or so persons in prison for post-9/11 terrorism crimes got further than plotting before they were charged and convicted)” (2016). Calls for incarceration on the low level of evidence provided for a peace bond will put many people in prison who pose no material threat to anyone (except perhaps to themselves). It will, however, give an opportunity for expansion of the security, surveillance, and policing apparatus as well as the prison-industrial complex, which is precisely what many police agencies and politicians alike desire.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some hawks will call for greater integration of security and intelligence services. This will include not only calls for tighter integration or greater communication and information transfer between agencies within the Canadian state (among local police forces, the RCMP, CSIS, perhaps the military). It will also include calls for greater integration and/or communication between the Canadian agencies and external agencies like the FBI or MI5. This will be highlighted especially given the apparently lead and crucial role played by the FBI in the Driver affair. Indeed even liberal critics like Forcese have been quick to proclaim that coordination between police and CSIS, as in the Driver case “is welcome” (proclaiming even before all the facts are known that “the system worked” in this case) (see Forcese 2016).</p>
<p>Menacingly the Liberal government has suggested a focus on counter-radicalization strategies. While they have provided not even general notions of what this might entail there are examples from other liberal democracies that open ominous possibilities, including the case in the UK in which legislation requires post-secondary faculty to report to police instances in which students appear to be radicalizing. Notably some have used the Driver example to argue that the so-called religious therapy provision in anti-terror peace bonds, deemed “deprogramming” by the court and struck down, should have been upheld and should now be imposed in future cases.</p>
<p>Following the Aaron Driver killing the Liberal government is clearly open to additions to the apparatus as part of the C-51 discussions. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, addressing questions after the Driver killing said the government will now “consult Canadians about what else they want to see in their national security framework” (quoted in Wherry 2016). What else indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In all of this the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver provides another example of the political production of fear for purposes of state, particularly police, expansion. It provides another opportunity for the dramatization of evil by state authorities at various levels. This can in turn be used to shore up or develop new mechanisms of surveillance, criminalization, and punishment. It can be used to reinforce legislation, like C-51, that faces criticism and possible revision. It can provide the impetus for new, more repressive, legislation. It can be used to increase the flow of resources to agencies like the RCMP. In addition such moments of manipulable terror panic can be used to spread policing practices into other sectors. Such is the case in legislation, as in the UK that seeks to turn professors into spies, snitches, or cops.</p>
<p>All of this must be resisted. Police must always be challenged and countered on their exclusive descriptions of events (and monopoly on knowledge about the circumstances of such cases). Police accounts should never be accepted at face value. There must also be public mobilizations against any and all attempts to expand the security state apparatus. Furthermore, public manipulation of terror panics must be called out and attempts by state and media actors to manufacture social phobias confronted.</p>

The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

The SIU further suggests that police officers arrived at a residence near Bovaird Drive and McLaughlin Road sometime later. There police reportedly “interacted with a man” who was then taken to hospital where he later died. The SIU statement did not provide any specific detail regarding what the “interaction” entailed, any details of the man’s injuries, or why the 911 call was made in the first place.</p>
<p>The SIU has said in a statement that two officers are under investigation. Details about the victim’s identity have not been released publicly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
       ***<p>Details are still emerging about a police involved shooting at the Northumberland Hills Hospital emergency room during which two people were left dead, at least one whom was killed by police. The incident unfolded right before midnight, Friday, October 27, 2017, at the hospital in Cobourg, Ontario, a small town about 115 Kilometers east of Toronto. The two victims are a husband and wife in their 70s. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating.</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Jason Gennaro has publicly stated that police in Cobourg were initially called to the hospital emergency room on reports of the sound of gunshots at about 11 PM. The SIU reports that police claim they encountered the 70-year-old man and two officers fired their weapons striking the man and killing him. He was pronounced dead on the scene. The SIU reports that officers then found a 76-year-old woman who was dead, apparently of some type of head wound.</p>
<p>The SIU has only confirmed that the couple were admitted to hospital. “for unknown ailments” and that at some point in the evening they had been next to each other on gurney’s in a triage area of the emergency room. Other important details have not been released publicly or confirmed.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation that the woman had been shot, but Gennaro would not confirm that. It has also not been confirmed at this point that the man had any type of weapon.</p>
<p>One witness claims hearing at least five or six shots after police arrived. Other witnesses have reported hearing multiple shots in a manner that suggested to them the use of an assault weapon.</p>
<p>Northumberland Hills Hospital has only confirmed in a statement that there was a “serious incident” in its emergency department that involved a weapon. There are no details on whether this refers to the police weapons or another weapon. The SIU has not confirmed that the man had a weapon, but questions have been asked of the hospital how a patient with a gun could be admitted.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned six investigators and two forensic investigators to investigate this shooting by police.</p>
       ***<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano, a York police officer, will be headed to trial for a third time on charges of dangerous driving causing death for the killing of 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado in February 2014. Romano (45) was on duty and behind the wheel of an undercover police pickup truck when he struck Natasha Abogado as she attempted to cross St. Clair Avenue East around 8 PM.</p>
<p>Romano was traveling at a speed of least 109 kilometers per hour in a 60-km/hr zone. He was reportedly trying to catch up to other members of his surveillance team, not I active pursuit of anyone.</p>
<p>Romano was tried in May 2016, but a jury was did not come to a unanimous verdict after a few days of deliberating, resulting in a mistrial. Romano was tried again in September 2016 and a jury acquitted him of dangerous driving causing death. Following that decision, the Crown prosecutor filed an appeal, citing issues with the way in which the judge directed the jury to come to its verdict (Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>On September 28, 2017, a panel of three court of appeal judges agreed with the Crown and ordered a new trial. They found that the trial judge, Justice Brian O’Marra, did wrongly explain the dangerous driving law to the jury. Specifically, the judge incorrectly instructed the jurors not only to focus on how Romano’s actions as a driver caused Abogado’s death, but also how the victim Abogado herself might have been at fault (Beattie 2017). Another case of victim blaming to excuse or justify a police killing of a civilian.</p>
<p>Justice David Paciocco said in his decision: “Most significantly, the trial judge made irrelevant and adverse comments about Ms. Abogado’s conduct” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>Incredibly, according to Paciocco, O’Marra instructed the jury to consider that Abogado was jaywalking and described that as an “inherently risky activity” (despite the fact that people do it all the time without harm) and that “pedestrians must be aware, when they jaywalk, that drivers are not always paying attention, not always concentrating on what is going on ahead of them” (quoted in Beattie 2017). Even more O’Marra took a page out of the “what was she wearing” playbook for dismissing women victims of crime, and argued that Abogado’s clothing was dark and had “poor visibility” at the time of the collision (Beattie 2017). This was simply a replay, and reinforcement, of the Romano legal team’s defense ploy to get their client off.</p>
<p>The appeals decision noted that these statements turned the jury’s attention away from the central issue of whether or not Romano’s driving was itself, in fact, dangerous (Beattie 2017). By then the damage had been done to the Crown’s case. Concluded Paciocco: “The errors in the charge … are sufficiently serious that the jury was not in a position to evaluate properly the dangerousness of the operation of the motor vehicle, leading to a miscarriage of justice” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>At the second trial, Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter pointed out that Romano operated his vehicle at such a high rate of speed that it became impossible for him to adjust his driving in the event that something unexpected happened (Beattie 2017). Even more, his speeding was entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable according to the Crown. The surveillance operation that Romano was part of was only focused on intelligence-gathering and, as such, was neither dangerous nor urgent (Beattie 2017). It should never have resulted in the death of an innocent young woman.</p>
<p>York Regional police have confirmed that Detective-Constable Remo Romano is still an active officer on the force.</p>

       ***<p>There used to be an old saying, “Help the police, beat yourself up.” Now Michael Edelson, the lawyer for killer Ottawa cop Daniel Montsion, wants a court and the public to believe that the vicious beating his client inflicted on 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi had nothing to do with killing him. Instead, he suggests Abdi died of a heart attack. And he apparently wants people to believe that, even if he did have a heart attack, a severe beating with baton by police did not play a part in it. So, according to copagandist Edelson, Abdi is responsible for his own death: not the brutal assault he was subjected to. Maybe he beat himself to death.</p>
<p>Edelson made these absurd and offensive claims in an attempt to move up the court date for officer Montsion. According to audio court transcripts from the October 20 hearing, Edelson suggested: “This is not a beating that caused the death of Mr. Abdi. Mr. Abdi died of a heart attack. That’s what killed him.” Montsion has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in the killing of Abdi in July 2016.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s request to move the trial date was denied. The 12-week trial remains scheduled to start in February 2019, which is almost three years after Abdi’s killing.</p>

On Thursday, June 15, 2017 The Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions for the province announced its decision not to lay charges against the officers responsible. The Lac-Simon force was not investigated by an independent body but  rather by Montreal police who made the recommendation, not surprisingly, not to lay charges.</p>
<p>Four officers had been sent to Michel’s home, in the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon in western Quebec just south of Val-d&#8217;Or, apparently in response to a domestic call. Police claim to have approached Michel on the basis that he was known to them. The police report says Michel exited his house carrying a machete but notes that officers drove into him with their police car. No statement on whether or not this is standard and sanctioned police procedure. Yet the Montreal police did suggest that it was legal activity with which the Director agreed with. When this did not give them the desired result an officer fired four shots and killed the man.</p>
<p>Since this investigation was begun Quebec has established an oversight body the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations). Only two days before the Lac-Simon announcement, critics held a press conference claiming the BEI was neither transparent nor effective.</p>

The investigation continues.;    Persons who died IN police custody       ***<p>Eight investigators of Quebec’s BEI (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Bureau of Independent Investigations) are examining the police killing of a 41-year-old man in the town of Beauceville, approximately 90 kilometers south of Quebec City. The provincial police, the Sureté du Québec (SQ), claims its officers were responding to a 911 call at around 9:45 AM regarding a domestic dispute. The victim was shot at least once. None of the SQ claims has been independently verified.</p>
       ***<p>It is among the rarest of occurrences in Canada that a killer cop is ever charged for taking the life of a civilian. Oversight agencies, which are not autonomous or independent of police, prosecutors, and judges work to ensure that the state protects the state and killer cops are legitimized. On Wednesday, May 24, 2017 one of those rare events occurred with the laying of charges against Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert who killed 46-year-old Bony Jean-Pierre on March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Murder charges against police are unheard of and officer Gilbert has been charged with manslaughter. He shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a rubber bullet, a projectile that police routinely use, as in protests for example, and which police propagandists pose as non-lethal.  The charges were announced by Quebec’s Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP). Officer Gilbert was released under a promise to appear on July 6, 2017.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), Quebec’s investigation unit, which now examines incidents of police harm to civilians was not established when the investigation into Jean-Pierre’s killing was initiated. Instead the charges come, incredibly, following an investigation by Quebec provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ).</p>
<p>The Montreal North community, long angered by police targeting and violence organized and mobilized in response to the police killing of Jean-Pierre. At least 100 people participated in a march and rally in June. At that time some cars and banks were vandalized and objects thrown at the police station in a community uprising. The march occurred on what would have been the 26th birthday of Fredy Villanueva, a young man shot and killed by police in 2008 when Montreal policed moved aggressively to break up a game of dice in a park. Yes, he was killed for playing dice. The killing of Fredy Villanueva highlighted the racist targeted policing practices of Montreal police, reinforced by the killing of Bony Jean-Pierre.</p>
       ***<p>Brandon Maurice was shot and killed by a Sûreté du Québec officer on November 16, 2015 in Messine (near Maniwaki) following a vehicular pursuit. On May 19, 2017, the province’s chief coroner,  Catherine Rudel-Tessier, ordered an inquest into the teenager’s killing by police. The inquest will be overseen by deputy chief coroner Luc Malouin. It cannot assign blame but can only make recommendations to address future such incidents. These are typically ignored or not implemented by police agencies under review.</p>
<p>Montreal police investigated their provincial colleagues, completing their examination in June 2016. Quite predictably they found for their colleague and concluded that no charges would be brought against their fellow officer. Yet the officer had fired wildly in the general direction of the driver, said to have been Maurice, and only luckily avoided hitting a passenger in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Maurice’s family was not satisfied with that investigation and found it illegitimate for police to be investigating police. In the words of Brandon Maurice’s mother, Dominique Bernier in 2016: “Police officers protect each other.” Indeed they do. The family’s view, quite reasonable, is that  investigations cannot be impartial when police investigate their colleagues. The family believes the officer used force that was excessive for a stopped car starting to drive away from an officer.</p>

They placed her in handcuffs before realizing her condition appeared to be “deteriorating.” She was taken to hospital, where she died. The cause of death remains under investigation.;    Persons who died IN police custody       <p>It is a situation that is happening far too frequently in the Canadian policing context. Experiencing mental distress is levied a death sentence when police are sent to intervene. On Wednesday, January 25, 2017, Nadia Racine (34) died from injuries sustained during a violent arrest by Gatineau police the day before. Racine was injured and had been taken to hospital after police arrested her in her apartment at 24 Rue Charles-Albanel.</p>
<p>Sadly police were responding to a simple noise complaint called in by a neighbor who heard banging and screaming coming from the victim’s apartment. Shawn Lescard, who lives in the apartment directly above hers recounted: “It sounded like she was getting beaten. I wanted to save her life. I thought she was getting beaten and that&#8217;s why I called the cops. Now&#8230;she’s passed away” (quoted in CBC News 2017). Calling the cops too often ends fatally when mental health issues are involved and should not be an option when someone is experiencing mental distress. Lescard called the Gatineau police non-emergency phone line. He was shaken by news of his neighbor’s death:  “She seemed like a good person. Quiet. She [kept] to herself. It&#8217;s pretty sad the way she went” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>According to the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the provincial body that examines police harm to civilians in Quebec, Gatineau police said officers responded to the noise complaint at around 6:14 PM Tuesday. BEI spokesman Martin Bonin-Charron reports that when police arrived at Racine&#8217;s apartment they received no answer at the door and then forced their way in. Inside the apartment they claim to have found Racine in a state of “mental distress.” According to Bonin-Charron: “She was banging her head around the apartment” (quoted in CBC News 2017). The BEI has not said anything about the arrest that led to Racine’s injuries that did report police put her in handcuffs. According to the BEI: “The police officers, they handcuffed her before realizing she was in [medical] distress” (quoted in CBC News 2017). It is not clear why police handcuffed someone who at most was suggested as a victim of assault based on the call put in by the neighbor Lescard. One might well note the contradiction in the police reports already though. On one hand they say they entered the apartment to find the victim in distress but on the other hand they claim to have handcuffed her before realizing she was in distress.</p>
<p>The BEI has assigned eight investigators to this case. They are not an independent oversight body and as a result will be joined in the investigation (and monitored) by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police.</p>

;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>A 28-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died during an “interaction” with Montreal police on Monday, March 6, 2016. The incident occurred around 2 AM when police attended a residence in Ile-Bizard where they claim the victim was intoxicated and involved in some form of domestic dispute. The man died despite efforts of paramedics to revive him.</p>
<p>Quebec’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the unit that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in the province is examining the case. None of the police claims have been independently verified publicly.</p>
       *<p>Koray Kevin Celik (28) died during a police intervention at his family’s Île-Bizard home one year ago. On March 6, 2018, his family organized a vigil outside the Pierrefonds police station to commemorate their loved one and raise some troubling questions about police actions, and accounts of their actions, in Koray Celik’s death. Celik’s parents, Cesur and June, say their son needs to be remembered and what happened to him needs to be discussed publicly. And this discussion needs to happen loudly and often until there is some change (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Koray Kevin Celik, 28, died during a police intervention at the family’s Île-Bizard home one year ago when the young man was experiencing some distress. Said Cesur Celik: “My son was in crisis and was in a vulnerable state. When the police walked in, he was standing. When they left, they carried his body out. He lost his life in their hands, in front of our eyes.” (quoted in Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Celik acknowledged that the parents called the police seeking help and assistance. The call was made a bit before 2 AM. The parents did not want him their son to hurt himself or to leave the house (Feith 2018). They now express regret at having called police at all.</p>
<p>What happened during the police intervention is under investigation. Few details have been made public. According to Quebec’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the body that examines police interventions connected to deaths or injuries in the province, Montreal police responded to a call regarding a distressed man. The official story says that upon arriving at the house in Île-Bizard, Koray Celik became aggressive and suffered a fatal heart attack while police tried to control him (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Cesur Celik, who says he witnessed the interaction in his home, rejects the bureau’s public version of events. He says four officers “brutally and viciously beat” his son before he died (2018). The family is considering legal action against the Montreal police force. They have tried to see a police incident report, autopsy, or coroner’s report but their efforts have been thwarted at each turn. The lack of information has added to the family’s grief. Says Cesur Celik: “We’ve been living with this nightmare ever since. One year later and there is still nothing. How can that be?” (quoted Feith 2018).</p>
<p>The Montreal police force (SPVM) has refused to comment on what happened the night Koray Celik died. Since June 2016, the BEI has investigated 72 cases. These include 37 fatal police interventions and five deaths that occurred during police detention (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>At the March 6 vigil, family and friends held signs reading : “Justice for Koray”; “We will not go away”; “The law applies to everyone” (Feith 2018).</p>

The Old Brewery Mission  reported that Cloutier was a long-time client who had attended the shelter especially for meals and changes of clothing. Shelter director Matthew Pearce said that Cloutier had participated in a program at Maison Claude-Laramée for homeless people with mental health issues, a program run jointly by the shelter and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (CBC 2017). Cloutier had no attended the shelter for four years after completing the program. Pearce reported that over the past year, Cloutier had been a “fairly frequent visitor” and seemed fine the day of the shooting, stopping by the cafeteria to get coffee (CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Surveillance camera video from the police killing of Cloutier shows the victim tossing a cup of liquid, presumed to be coffee from the shelter, on the ground before bending over, apparently to set something else down, before then picking up a bag and walking out of the view of the camera (CTV Montreal 2017). Cloutier is pursued by several police officers clearly holding firearms. The man was shot and killed only seconds later. Police claim that he was armed and made some “aggressive gesture” at them, but this has not been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>Indeed homeless people on the scene were upset that the police had used lethal force against Cloutier and deployed it so quickly. They have asked why no alternatives were attempted first. Police became aggrieve with homeless people on the scene who merely raised questions about the actions taken by police. Those wondering why police chose not to use less-lethal options have continued to raise concerns. According to Milosz Janda, the Old Brewery Mission social counsellor: “They just want to find out what was the reason for such behaviour? Why was it done that way? Why weren’t other possible approaches there?” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).</p>
<p>Cloutier is the fourth homeless person known to have been killed by Montreal police officers in the past few years. This fact is not lost on Old Brewery Mission director Matthew Pearce. He points out the awful history of police engagement with poor and homeless people. According to Pearce: “Four incidents of confrontation with the police, and four deaths. Not injuries – deaths. I have to feel that in each of those there were other options that could have been pursued” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He suggests that police are too fearful and stressed out by homeless and street involved people.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the police killing of Jimmy Cloutier are all too familiar for family members of other homeless people killed by Montreal Police. Pierre Magloire’s brother Alain was shot and killed by police two years ago. Magloire’s response to this latest killing was dismay. In his words: “I was, like, ‘Again? Oh my God.’ How come we are at the same place we were two, three years ago?” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He echoes the belief that police are too panicked in dealing with people who may be experiencing distress: “They are not ready to deal with someone. They are getting afraid very fast” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).</p>
<p>These killings are extreme forms of the poorbashing that police regularly inflict on homeless people. It extends from habitual police practices of harassment, intimidation, bullying, and violence. It reflects police perspectives that view homeless people as “problems” or unworthy victims, or detritus.</p>

       ***<p>On Friday, January 6, 2017, Montreal police shot and killed a man outside of the Old Brewery Mission. As if inflicting this trauma on homeless people who witnessed police violence was not enough, police then decided to become aggressive with clients of the shelter. It is suggested that the victim of the police shooting had been a client a of the Mission at various points over the course off 11 years.</p>
<p>According to Matthew Pearce, the Director General of the Old Brewery Mission, police became aggressive with people upset by the use of lethal force. Pearce relates: “I was told there was an incident where someone made a critical remark to the police. And the police reacted with some degree of aggression” (quoted in CBC News 2017). The violent response by police to even mild criticism from the public is too common and raises questions about police views on the communities they claim to protect and serve. Pearce suggests that the response was inappropriate. In his words: “We feel that the reaction that the police had to that remark was excessive and I&#8217;ll be following up with Montreal&#8217;s police chief” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Pearce noted too the harm that can be done by actions such as the aggressive police targeting of shelter clients. He notes: “Our role is to reduce tensions at all times so it is a concern to us when third parties like the police are inside our building. We don’t want them to contribute to the creating of issues that we then have to work to resolve” (quoted in CBC News 2017). Yet this sort of behavior is too common among police, particularly where homeless and street involved people are concerned.</p>
<p>The Mission&#8217;s Director General is now working overtime to ensure that people on the street are confident that the mission is a safe place. According to Pearce: “It’s essential that people, when they come inside the mission, they are leaving the street behind so they are coming to a place of respect of dignity and of security” (quoted in CBC News 2017). A coroner’s investigation earlier suggested that police need improved training when dealing with people who may suffer mental health issues following the killing of a homeless man more than two years ago (CBC News 2016). Psychologists are working with people traumatized by the police action.</p>

       ***<p>Police in Canada did not waste much time into the new year before claiming their first civilian victim of 2017. Montreal police killed the man on the afternoon of Friday, January 6. Police in Quebec also claimed the final civilian death of 2016.</p>
<p>After reports of someone being attacked inside a building at the corner of René-Lévesque Boulevard and St-Urbain Street around 2:30 p.m., a man was followed into an alley near the Old Brewery Mission, on St-Laurent Boulevard, behind the homeless shelter. There he was engaged by officers who ended up shooting and killing him.  Montreal police Const. Daniel Lacoursière reported that the officers fired multiple times at the victim, hitting him at least once in his upper body.</p>
<p>The man was transported to hospital, where he later died of the wounds inflicted by officers. The person who was reportedly injured inside the building are not life-threatening.</p>
<p>This case has been handed over to Quebec’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations) which examines instances of police harm to civilians in the province but which is not a truly independent agency. Nine investigators are initially assigned to investigate this shooting.</p>
<p>Disturbingly media reports immediately turned to poor bashing and criminalization of the victim. Some mused that he was a homeless person who used the shelter. Others suggested that he was a drug dealer (see Durfel 2017). None of this has been confirmed or even suggested by witnesses or members of the BEI.</p>

Jo-Anne Malcolm says she found out about her son’s killing when representatives of the Independent Investigations Unit (IIU) came to her home around 6:00 AM. Malcolm recounts that interaction: “They said, ‘Do you know Adrian?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, that’s my son.’ I knew right away, I didn’t even ask. I said, ‘Is he dead?’ and they said, ‘Yeah. Sorry to tell you, ma’am. He was shot this morning” (quoted in Malone 2017). This is the ninth police shooting of a civilian in Manitoba since June 2015.</p>

       *<p>On Tuesday, April 24, 2018, two inquests were called into separate police killings of civilians in Manitoba which happened within a week and a half of each other in September 2017. The chief medical examiner in Manitoba has called an inquest into the police shooting and killing of 23-year-old Adrian Lacquette of Winnipeg on September 13. Manitoba Justice announced a separate inquest into the shootings and killings of 33-year-old Evan Grant Caron, who was fatally shot by police 10 days after the shooting of Adrian Lacquette.</p>
<p>Both victims were Indigenous men. This fact is reflective of the colonial and racist violence of policing in Manitoba (and Canada more broadly). At least 11 of the known 19 people killed by police in Manitoba between 2000 and 2017 were identified as Indigenous.</p>
<p>The inquests cannot assign blame or lead to arrests and police are under no obligation to follow any recommendations that might result from either inquest.</p>

That evening, Chrisjohn was taken to hospital in an ambulance and later pronounced dead. The investigation recommended charges of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life. The Crown chose to drop the charges against one of the officers, but will proceed against the other.; Police responded to a call about a woman disrupting traffic at an intersection. The officer was told by dispatchers that police had dealt with her the day before and had found she was high on methamphetamine. The officer found Debra Chrisjohn in a deteriorated condition, slumped in the back of her car.He didn't ask for a medical assesment for Chrisjohn when paramedics arrived on the scene. Instead, he drove her to meet with OPP officers to transfer her into their custody. Her condition further deteriorated in their custody. She was taken to hospital and died. The officer was found guilty of negligence in her death, but continues to be employed by the London Police Service as he awaits sentencing. She was a mother of 11 children and grandmother to two. Chrisjohn's sister said she had started taking methadone for her drug addiction, and was starting to get her life back on track.;    Persons who died following a police intervention;    <p>A judge in London, Ontario, has found Constable Nicholas Doering guilty in the death of 39-year-old Debra Chrisjohn, an Indigenous woman, the mother of 11 children, who died shortly after being arrested. Chrisjohn, of Oneida of the Thames First Nation, was arrested on September 7, 2016, after police were to Trafalgar Street and Highbury Avenue North, an intersection in London’s east end, regarding a woman allegedly obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>Chrisjohn was arrested by London police and then transferred to the Elgin County OPP detachment. Paramedics later took her to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital at 7:52 PM. She was pronounced dead almost one hour later.</p>
<p>Constable Nicholas Doering was charged with criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessaries of life. Ontario Provincial Police Const. Mark McKillop had also been charged but his charge was later dropped.</p>
<p>The conviction of a police officer in the death of a civilian remains rare in Canada. Yet it is worth noting that this conviction comes only a day after killer cop Justin Holz was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing death for killing Cody Severight, a 23-year-old Indigenous man in 2017.</p>
       ***<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, “panicked” during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.</p>
<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion’s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion’s story conflicted both with Adoyta’s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya’s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man’s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he “sort of panicked” and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion’s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the “manner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta’s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta’s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept” (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: “This is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta” (quoted in Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.</p>
<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled “gun” around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.</p>
<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted “evidence.” So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion’s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.</p>

       *<p>No explanation has been given for why charges of criminal negligence causing death have been dropped against Constable Mark McKillop of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) in the death of Debra Chrisjohn (39) of Oneida Nation of the Thames.</p>
<p>In a public statement Chrisjohn’s family said this about the dropping of charges: “The decision by the Crown… is hard for the family to understand. We hope that everyone who played a role will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province,  had charged two police officers with the death of Chrisjohn—Constable Nicholas Doering of the London Police Service (LPS) and OPP Constable McKillop. McKillop and Doering faced one charge each of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life. Doering will still face those charges.</p>
<p>London Police Service officers responded to calls made to 911 during the late afternoon of September 7, 2016. Chrisjohn was arrested by LPS and transferred into the custody of Ontario Provincial Police with the Elgin County detachment.  At around 7:52 PM, Emergency Medical Services transported Chrisjohn to St. Thomas Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 8:43 PM.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Kasper, a lawyer at Aboriginal Legal Services and counsel for the family, noted that the family has still not been provided with basic details of the death of their loved one. Kasper explained in the public statement:</p>
<p>“Without knowing the specific details surrounding the death of Debra, it is difficult for the family to assess the decision by the office of the Crown attorney. However, we know that as this active prosecution moves towards preliminary inquiry or trial, more details will emerge. In the meantime, I certainly expect that the Ontario Provincial Police will be thoroughly reviewing the actions of Const. McKillop to determine if there were breaches of the Police Services Act.”</p>
       *<p>Nearly a year after the death of Debra Chrisjohn in police custody, and even after the filing of charges against police officers responsible, Constable Mark McKillop of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Constable Nicholas Doering of the London Police Service, many issues remain unaddressed and unanswered about police actions in her arrest, detention, and death. Beyond the specific actions undertaken by police, the circumstances of Chrisjohn’s death raise issues of police racism and violence against Indigenous people and communities.</p>
<p>Debra Chrisjohn (39) of the Oneida Nation of the Thames was arrested on September 7, 2016. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, announced on July 13, 2017, that constables McKillop and Doeriing have been charged with one count each of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessaries of life. Both had contact with Chrsijohn on the day she died. The family has received few facts about the death of their loved one beyond this.</p>
<p>The family wants to know why the officers did not seek medical attention for their loved one when it became apparent that she needed help. Debra Chrisjohn’s father Robert Chrisjohn, asks: “Why didn’t the police take her to the hospital sooner when they knew she was sick and needed help? The police arrested her and were responsible for making sure she was okay. This happens way too often in our community. This happens all the time. The police just don’t seem to care” (quoted in McQuigge 2017)</p>
<p>Caitlyn Kasper, of Toronto’s Aboriginal Legal Services, claims that police had enough information available to deal with Debra Chrisjohn’s case in a different way. For example, police knew that Chrisjohn had a documented history of both substance abuse and mental illness. At the time of her arrest and detention on September 7, 2017, there were clear indications that Chrisjohn was in need of medical attention, not time in police custody</p>
<p>The family and community advocates insist that any discussion related to the actions of these officers in this case must address the troubling behaviors of police forces across Canada in dealing with Indigenous communities. This is, of course, an ongoing history of colonial violence and brutality. In the words of Caitlyn Kasper: “What happened to Debra is not an isolated incident. It is very obvious that it isn’t these types of issues just in London or the Oneida First Nation. It’s a concern we hear about in Toronto, all across Ontario and all across Canada” (quoted in McQuigge 2017)</p>
<p>.According to Kasper, the case against the officers must focus on what she terms the “foundational relationship” between police and Indigenous people across the Canadian state (McQuigge 2017). Kasper notes the ongoing questions of police responsibility in cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, Many believe that police have been purposefully negligent in investigating those cases. Others suggest that police are themselves involved in the killings and disappearances of Indigenous women. Samantha Doxtator, a friend of the victim, has stitched together traditional moccasin vamps to commemorate Debra Chrisjohn and is sending them to be included in an art installation in memory of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Giselle Dias, an area psychotherapist who has spent 25 years working for prisoners’ rights, insists it be acknowledged that Indigenous and marginalized communities are most impacted by the criminal justice system in Canada. She agrees that Chrisjohn&#8217;s death points fundamentally to the a systemic issue of over-policing and mistreatment within racialized communities (Ghonaim 2017). And she is rightly not optimistic about the court process offering any redress. In her words: “Just because these police officers have been charged, it doesn’t mean that they’re going to be found guilty. I will not rest assured” (quoted in Ghonaim 2017).</p>
<p>In case after case this truth remains. The system protects itself and that includes protecting killer cops.</p>

       *<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the body that examines cases of police harm to civilians has announced that two police officers have been charged in the 2016 death of Debra Chrisjohn, of Oneida Nation of the Thames. The officers charged are Ontario Provincial Police Constable Mark McKillop and London Police Service Constable Nicholas Doering. The killer cops face charges of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life, respectively. Chrisjohn, died while in police custody, only an hour after she was taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Details surrounding the death have not been made available and many questions remain to be answered. What has been said, though there has been no independent confirmation, is that London police were called to Trafalgar Street and Highbury Avenue North, a neighborhood in that city’s east end on September 7, 2016 for someone supposedly obstructing traffic. Chrisjohn was arrested by London police for the obstruction and then transferred to the Elgin County OPP detachment supposedly on an outstanding warrant from 2013.</p>
<p>The rest remains obscure, with the SIU refusing even to name a cause of death publicly. So far they have only been willing to offer that at some point on the afternoon of September 7, 2016, Chrisjohn was moved to a jail operated by the OPP. Chrisjohn was taken by paramedics from the jail to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital at 7:52 PM. She was pronounced dead there at 8:43 PM.</p>
<p>Even family members have not been given toxicology results or been told details of their loved one’s death in custody. This is a stark situation given repeated calls for transparency in the SIU and its reporting system.</p>
<p>Constable Doering could face up to five years in jail, while Constable McKillop faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. It virtually never happens that a killer cop is convicted for their actions let alone receiving a maximum sentence. Both officers are still on duty. McKillop is on active duty with the OPP, while Doering is doing administrative duties</p>
<p>Members of the Oneida Nation of the Thames hope that these charges will bring some attention to the mistreatment of Indigenous women by police. Complaints have long been raised against various police services for inflicting extreme violence, including sexual violence, against Indigenous women.</p>

Neighbours speculated that he had mental health issues. Coriolan's family is suing the City of Montreal, alleging excessive use of force by police.; Pierre Coriolan had a screwdriver in one had and a knife in the other while sitting in his apartment, according to the DPCP.  Police responding to a caller who said Coriolan was destroying items in his apartment. Officers yelled at Coriolan to ""drop the weapon,"" eventually they used a stun gun and rubber bullets to try to subdue him, but said both were unsuccessful. Coriolan was subsequently shot several times and died a few hours later in hospital. The coroner of this case and Coriolan's family asked the police what more could have been done to de-escalate the situation, in a civil suit against the city of Montreal.  The family says the police used excessive force. ;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>The Montreal police have a terrible history of killing Black civilians. The names of some of the victims, such as Presley Leslie, Marcellus Francois, and Alain Magloire, give testimony to that fact. That is only part of the story as Black residents regularly speak out against racial profiling and violence directed against them by Montreal police. It is important to note, then, that the 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police on June 27, 2017, has been identified as a Black man by the BEI (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec. The victim has not yet been named.</p>
<p>The killing again raises many questions about the Montreal police force (though racism and regular deployment of lethal force are standards of police forces across Canada at municipal, provincial, and federal levels). As Fo Niemi, the executive director of Montreal’s Centre for Research Action on Race Relations, suggests: “It raises the question, ‘where do we go from here?’ Is this a case where race plays a role in this incident? Is it mental health? I think there are a lot of questions here that need to be asked because this is not a situation that should occur too often in this city” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Before being shot the man had only been suggested to be breaking things in his apartment. Surely not a capital, or even particularly harmful “offense.” As community activist Will Prosper, a former RCMP officer, puts it the man appears not have been “presenting a menace to anyone except to his apartment” (quoted in CBC News 2017). Yet police moved to coercive, then lethal means. Questions must be asked about the role of racism, or implicit bias, in this.</p>
<p>Critics note that police use of threatening behavior and the display of weapons will only make the situation worse in a case of someone experiencing mental distress or already feeling anxious and defensive. As Prosper suggests: “That’s not what you need to preserve the life of the citizen. It’s going to do the [complete opposite], and I think that’s probably what happened in this case” (quoted in CBC News 2017). In Prosper’s view, the man could have benefited from someone talking to and calming him down without the presence of weapons. In Prosper’s words: “If you&#8217;re saying ‘calm down’ and you have the gun pointed at his face, that’s not going to work” (quoted in CBC News 2017). This is why police should not be sent in such cases in place of health care providers (if anyone needs to be sent for smashing dishes at home at all).</p>
<p>Police racism and the killings of Black men have received too little public attention and ire. These realities have been ideologically downplayed by governments at all levels. They have also been distorted and denied by police officers, forces, and associations. Criminologists in Canada have also done too little to expose and challenge these issues, too often playing the part of police apologists. Black Lives Matter activists and movements have done much work to shift understandings in the Canadian context.</p>

       ***<p>Montreal police shot and killed a 58-year-old man in the mid-evening of June 27, 2017 outside his home. The man was shot multiple times by police at about 7:19 PM after they were apparently called out because the victim was said to be committing the high crime of destroying things in his own apartment near the corner of Robillard and St-André streets. Police claim they used a taser and rubber bullets on the man before deciding they needed to kill him.</p>
<p>City ambulance services have reported that the victim was in cardiac arrest when he was transported to hospital. The BEI (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec, is investigating.</p>
       <p>An intersection of racism, poverty, mental health distress, and police violence has once again had a  deadly outcome. The 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police has been identified as Pierre Coriolan, a Black male of Haitian background who was know to suffer mental health issues. It has now been further revealed that Coriolan was facing eviction from the apartment he had been living in since 2008 on July 1, 2017, and that this had understandably greatly distressed him. The eviction order was issued against Mr. Coriolan by the Quebec rental board on June 1 according to Claudine Laurin, director general of la Fédération des OSBL d’habitation de Montréal, an organization of subsidized housing apartments. That a subsidized housing association would evict someone over mental health issues is troubling.</p>

       *<p>An intersection of racism, poverty, mental health distress, and police violence has once again had a  deadly outcome. The 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police has been identified as Pierre Coriolan, a Black male of Haitian background who was know to suffer mental health issues. It has now been further revealed that Coriolan was facing eviction from the apartment he had been living in since 2008 on July 1, 2017, and that this had understandably greatly distressed him. The eviction order was issued against Mr. Coriolan by the Quebec rental board on June 1 according to Claudine Laurin, director general of la Fédération des OSBL d’habitation de Montréal, an organization of subsidized housing apartments. That a subsidized housing association would evict someone over mental health issues is troubling.</p>

This time the victim was a woman (said to be 27-years-old). With more than a month left in the year CPS officers have now shot 10 people and killed five. This is outrageous behavior even for police and suggests that this particular force, in a mid-sized city, is confident that members will face no consequences for use of extreme, lethal, violence.

<p>Executed for “Acting Erratically”</p>
<p>The woman was engaged by police in the early morning of Tuesday, November 29 in Sunalta around the 1700 block of 11the Avenue S.W. Police claim they were called to the neighborhood around 2:30 AM.

<p>“I was appalled and disgusted and absolutely shocked that they would have to use that kind of force, or they would determine that kind of force was required. She was always really nice in the hallway. We knew each others’ names. Our dogs liked each other. She was pleasant. She never seemed threatening or scary or anything like that.

<p>The Calgary force has taken to issuing and carrying out extrajudicial death sentences for very low level activities. And the threshold appears to be getting lower. Terrence Weinmeyer was executed for being in a possibly stolen vehicle. The woman killed on November 29 was executed for supposedly acting erratically.

Claimed Chaffin the fault lies not with an out of control force that has apparently gotten a taste for blood, but with general opioid use (in the city?; the province?; the country?). This has become too simple, and too simplistic. The chief cannot be taken seriously at this point. Not further that Chief Chaffin has offered public warnings, not so thinly veiled threats really, to whistleblowers within the force.</p>
<p>His pat answer about social drug use cannot explain why someone banging on windows and doors would be shot and killed so quickly and without pursuit of alternatives by CPS officers.

When Wienmeyer pulled the truck into a shopping mall parking lot and entered a store, police vehicles attempted to box the truck in. When Wienmeyer returned he jumped into the truck and rammed two police cars. Two officers opened fire, and Wienmeyer was pulled from the vehicle and taken to hospital, where he died of gunshot wounds.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>Calgary police have become among the most deadly city forces in the country. The police war on drugs in Calgary has claimed yet another victim among these as a 49-year-old man, Terrence Weinmeyer, was shot and killed by police in a strip mall in the northwest part of the city on November 22, 2016. Weinmeyer is the fourth person killed and ninth person shot by Calgary police in 2016 alone. Weinmeyer’s brother described his loved one as: “He was a very good man with a big heart. He was a good father” (quoted in Grant 2016). Police tried to smear their victim by reporting his criminal record.</p>
<p>Calgary police have killed an inordinate number of people over the last year in protecting motor vehicles against being stolen. Extrajudicial execution seems a steep penalty for theft. And while police claim to be restricted in what they can say about such killings they have not held back in linking supposed vehicle thefts to drugs. Specifically they have played on growing public fears over fentanyl to justify police actions and explain away police killings of civilians. Even when there is no independently confirmed link to fentanyl.</p>
<p>This killing occurred, according to police, as officers in the break-and-enter unit were supposedly moving to make an arrest of someone in a vehicle. Police claim the vehicle reversed and police opened fire killing one person inside. Another person was apparently taken into custody, but no charges have been laid against her as of yet. The truck in question had been boxed in by police so it is not clear why police decided to shoot Weinmeyer when it seems the vehicle was not able to leave the scene. Witnesses reported having to swerve to avoid police and noted that they had been traumatized by police actions (Tucker 2016). The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates police killings of civilians, is investigating this case.</p>
<p>Calgary police superintendent James Hardy claimed he could not provide any details of the incident and possible threats posed to the public because of the ASIRT investigation. Yet he felt that it was alright to attribute the victim’s actions to opiate use, which should have been similarly subject to ASIRT conditions, and which was not independently confirmed at the time the statement was made publicly. According to Hardy (despite claims that he cannot provide details): “As you are well aware, in what seems to be a nightly occurrence, the high frequency of crimes like stolen vehicles gives rise to serious officer and public safety concerns. You have these stolen vehicles and when these individuals are on opiates, they press hard” (quoted in Anderson 2016). Yet there is nothing in this case to suggest the public faced any direct safety concerns.</p>
<p>The contradiction in police speaking while saying they could not speak was hinted at by ASIRT executive director Susan Hughson. She acknowledged: “From time to time there may be a disagreement from CPS (Calgary Police Service) needs compared to our needs” (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>
<p>Clearly this was an opportunistic statement from Calgary police provided first to justify the killing by police, and secondly to stoke public fears and prejudices in a manner favorable to police drug war activities.</p>
<p>Violence by Calgary Police Service officers has kept ASIRT busy the last two years. In 2015 they had 78 files which represented a 100 percent increase over what had been the recorded average over the period 2008 to 2013. In 2016, with a month left in the year, they are at 74 files (Tucker 2016).</p>

       ***<p>Police agencies and their ideological supporters, often located in criminology and psychology departments in universities and colleges, have developed entire cottage industries producing pseudo-science and pseudo-forensics, phony analyses, concepts, and terms, to justify and excuse police killings of civilians. These pseudo-scientific projects have constructed their own literatures, bodies of ideas, and “expert” witnesses supporting dubious “diagnoses” used to “explain” how it is that victims of police violence came to be responsible (biologically or psychologically) for their own murders.</p>
<p>Among the most pernicious and extensively developed and deployed of these pseudo-scientific diagnoses are the notorious notions of excited delirium and so-called suicide by cop. Neither of these has any scientific basis or legitimate supporting evidence to back them. They offer little, in fact, beyond the statements of police “researchers” (cops and former cops who have used such work not only to support their colleagues and former colleagues but to claim positions in academia) and some compliant criminologists and psychologists and others supportive of police on ideological or opportunistic grounds (i.e. funding).</p>
<p>While the dubious claim of excited delirium has no psychological or medical basis it is routinely used to let police officers walk away from any accountability when they kill civilians. Despite the recognition that excited delirium has no basis in scientific, psychological or medical, reality, it is still used in investigative cases on police killings, often by coroners’ offices in the Canadian context, for example.</p>
<p>In Canada the excited delirium excuse was used to let killer cops off the hook in two cases within a three week period over October and November of 2016. These cases involved the police killing of Maurizio Facchin (50) in Burnaby, British Columbia, in 2014 and Simon Chung (34) in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2013. Both cases involved the use of tasers by police and the men went into fatal distress only after a taser was used on them. Chung was also subjected to attempts by two Edmonton police to restrain him forcefully. He was tased twice by an officer while restrained, including one blast that lasted 28 seconds (Parsons 2016). In both cases the role of the taser in the men’s deaths was acknowledged yet both deaths were ruled accidental.</p>
<p>Notably in the case of the police killing of Simon Chung one of the officers claimed to suspect that the victim was experiencing excited delirium yet chose to restrain and taser him anyway. This would suggest culpability in his death given the claims of police that excited delirium could lead to a fatal response to either restraint or tasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dubious Diagnosis of Excited Delirium</p>
<p>Excited delirium has come under growing public scrutiny in recent years given the overwhelming proportion of diagnoses related to deaths involving police use of compliance holds and/or use of tasers. Typically these diagnoses are provided only by medical examiners not by hospital or emergency room doctors. Furthermore, and as alarming, there is the fact that excited delirium is presently not a recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis by either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IVTR) of the American Psychiatric Association or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) of the World Health Organization. Due to these troubling facts, it is widely considered that the real cause of death in cases identified after the fact as instances of excited delirium are actually caused by straightforward police violence and use if force. These are related to taser use and positional asphyxia.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups have argued that diagnoses of excited delirium are only applied after the fact to get police officers off the hook in cases in which excessive force has resulted in the death of a civilian. The NAACP reported in 2003 that excited delirium diagnoses are provided more often in explaining the deaths of minorities than they are in the deaths of white victims. In 2007, Eric Balaban of the American Civil Liberties Union noted that excited delirium was not recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Psychological Association and that the diagnosis simply served “as a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest” (NPR 2007). Melissa Smith of the American Medical Association confirmed in 2007 that the association had “no official policy” on the supposed condition (ABC News 2007).</p>
<p>Excited delirium is not recognized in Australia by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the Australian Medical Association or any other registered medical body. Neither is it recognized in law. A 2015 case, in which a man who had been declared to have died from excited delirium was overturned by a ruling in the Victorian Coroners Court. The presiding coroner in that case concluded that neither excited delirium nor so called excited delirium syndrome are appropriate or helpful in providing a legitimate medical cause of death (Coroner’s Court of Victoria at Melbourne 2015).</p>
<p>The Burnaby ruling in the Mauricio Facchin case is particularly stunning, and disappointing, given that Vancouver was site of the 2007 police killing of migrant Robert Dziekanski whose death police initially lied about publicly suggesting he suffered excited delirium. Video by a civilian witness showed this claim to be untrue as Dziekanski was following police instructions when he was tased and jumped by police causing his death. During the inquiry into police actions that police psychologist Mike Webster that police have been “brainwashed” by Taser International to justify “ridiculously inappropriate” use of the weapon. Webster referred to excited delirium as a “dubious disorder” pushed by Taser International during its police training (Hall 2008). A 2008 report on taser use by the RCMP, <em>An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</em>, concluded that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the Mounties in the absence of formal approval following consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body (Kiedrowski 2008). Justice Thomas Braidwood concluded the inquiry finding that excited delirium should not be used as part of police use of force training as it is not a legitimate medical condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommendations Based On What?</p>
<p>In the case of the coroner’s inquiry into the police killing of Maurizio Facchin, the coroner’s jury suggested that police receive training in identifying and properly responding to instances of excited delirium. It was also recommended that 911 dispatchers receive such training so that they might identify and inform police of potential excited delirium cases upon dispatch. Finally the jury suggested that officers contact emergency services when a taser is going to be deployed in such cases.</p>
<p>In the case of the police killing of Simon Chung, Provincial Court Judge Lloyd Malin provided two recommendations. In the first he suggested that while Edmonton Police Service mentions excited delirium syndrome in its policy and procedure manual on use of force, officers should also be trained to recognize the symptoms in all situations, not only during arrests. Malin also recommended that officers be trained to call for emergency medical services as soon as excited delirium is suspected. This call should be made regardless of the need for police to restrain an individual (Parsons 2016).</p>
<p>These recommendations are based on the dubious diagnosis of excited delirium and will do little to change police behavior, particularly violent behavior. They will not address police killings of civilians. The recommendations are based on treatment of a social fiction.</p>

A police officer shot and killed the man after two officers responded to a call at the Canadian Tire at Grandview Highway and Bentall Street. Police claim a robbery was in process when they arrived. A second man was taken into custody. Few details have yet been released.</p>
       ***<p>There is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.</p>
<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:</p>
<p>“As of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.” (IIO 2016)</p>
<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: “They are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.” (quoted in Kurjata 2016)</p>
<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.</p>
<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law—they are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.</p>
<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a “weapon” rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after</em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.</p>
<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:  “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that…it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Kurjata 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post</em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:</p>
<p>“Our message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it’s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.” (quoted in Humphreys 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.</p>

On Tuesday, October 11, 2016, Calgary police shot and killed 76-year-old grandfather Bob Crowle. This was the seventh shooting of a civilian by Calgary police so far in 2016 and resulted in the third fatality. Crowle was killed within moments of police encountering him in the garage of his house in the 100 block of Sunmount Crescent SE. The quick use of lethal force against people in distress is another characteristic of police killings of civilians that has become seemingly routine for officers.</p>
<p>Police were apparently responding to a call from the home at around 11 AM. Upon arrival police found an injured youth on the front lawn of the residence. It would later be revealed that the injured youth was Bob Crowle’s 20-year-old grandson. Police claim they heard noise in the garage and upon entering saw a vehicle with the engine running and a hose attached. Bob Crowle was apparently standing outside the car. Police say an eight-year veteran of the force fired at Crowle when he approached them supposedly holding an “edged” object. The victim was declared dead by paramedics soon thereafter. The grandson was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
<p>Police accounts do not fit with the experiences of family and friends who knew Bob Crowle. The victim’s sister, Marlene Junck, described the incident as being out of character for her brother. As she knew her brother: “He was a very gentle man” (quoted in Wood and Lumsden 2016). This is a view repeated by others who knew the man killed by police.</p>
<p>Neighbors have uniformly described Bob Crowle as a nice man. He was regularly seen out in his neighborhood walking his dog. In the words of one neighbor, Barb Warrior, Crowle “Would always stop in and say ‘Hi” (quoted in Bell 2016). Continued Warrior: “He had some surgery a few weeks ago and looked to be feeling a little off but he was still out walking his dogs this past week” (quoted in Bell 2016).</p>
<p>According to neighbor Wendy Rudko, Crowle was a “good person” (Wood and Lumsden 2016). In her view: “Just such a nice man. He was walking in the neighbourhood all the time — he walked down my back alley a lot — out walking his dog, multiple times a day” (quoted in Wood and Lumsden 2016).</p>
<p>Another neighbor identified Crowle as the “nicest guy ever” and a calm, easy-going neighbor” who picked and shared apples with neighbors but said he had had a rough time recently when his daughter and her son moved into the home he shared with his wife (quoted in Bell 2016). According to that neighbor: “He had a rough time with his grandson. I think he was driven to the edge. I think his grandson pushed him to the edge” (quoted in Bell 2016).</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the office that examines police harm to civilians in the province is investigating this killing. They do so in an environment in which Calgary police have shot and killed several people during the year. In addition the Calgary force’s chief has issued fairly open threats to police whistleblowers.</p>

<p>The fatal incident started when Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers attempted to intercept a vehicle that was apparently travelling at high speed near the Highway 930 intersection. After s minute long chase the crash occurred, killing the vehicle’s 20-year-old passenger and seriously injuring the driver, also 20. The driver was taken to hospital and remains there in critical condition.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enqûetes independents (BEI), the agency which investigates cases of police harm to civilians, is investigating. The BEI, which has only been operating since the summer of 2016, is composed of former officers and takes assistance from Montréal police, all of which calls into question its possible “independence.”</p>
       <p>Police should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues. This is becoming increasingly clear to many as such situations almost inevitably seem to end with the distressed person being killed by cops conditioned to expect the worst in everyone or trained to act on a “comply or die” basis in which any affront to their authority is grounds for immediate execution. Police forces across Canada are killing people experiencing distress on a regular basis. And so often they do so in cases where the distressed person is confined to an indoor setting posing no possible threat to the public. And usually no health care support personnel (doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, etc.) are involved.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 6, 2016, Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police officers shot and killed 29-year-old Danny Lafrance-Godmer during a police invasion of a home on Saint François Xavier Street in Montebello, Québec. Police were apparently responding to a call about a man in distress. They entered the home, eventually going into the attic where they encountered the man identified now as Danny Lafrance-Godmer. It is not clear why, given that police knew Lafrance-Godmer to be in distress and confined to an attic space where he posed no possible threat to the public, the force did not arrange for health care providers to be present to communicate with the man. Instead police engaged the victim immediately and shot him, killing him.</p>
<p>Few details have been released by the bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the relatively new agency that investigates cases of injuries or death involving police in the province. The bureau has assigned nine investigators to examine the case but has a curious policy of relying upon other police forces should they determine they need additional support. In this case they have said they will call upon the Montréal police. This raises real questions about the independence, autonomy, and, finally, legitimacy of any investigation undertaken under such circumstances.</p>
       ***<p>In the short span  of one day, a mere 24 hours, in early October 2016, police in Québec killed three people who were experiencing some type of mental distress, including at least two where the victims were believed to be suicidal.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening of October 2 the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) responded to a phone call apparently from a man in Île-Perrot threatening to kill himself. Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.</p>
<p>Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Québec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.</p>
<p>Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.</p>

<p>A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the École nationale de police du Québec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Québec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims “in an altered state of consciousness” (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Québec study. And they lack proper training.</p>
<p>To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was “suicide by cop” an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.</p>

       ***<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>
       *<p>Police should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues. This is becoming increasingly clear to many as such situations almost inevitably seem to end with the distressed person being killed by cops conditioned to expect the worst in everyone or trained to act on a “comply or die” basis in which any affront to their authority is grounds for immediate execution. Police forces across Canada are killing people experiencing distress on a regular basis. And so often they do so in cases where the distressed person is confined to an indoor setting posing no possible threat to the public. And usually no health care support personnel (doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, etc.) are involved.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 6, 2016, Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police officers shot and killed 29-year-old Danny Lafrance-Godmer during a police invasion of a home on Saint François Xavier Street in Montebello, Québec. Police were apparently responding to a call about a man in distress. They entered the home, eventually going into the attic where they encountered the man identified now as Danny Lafrance-Godmer. It is not clear why, given that police knew Lafrance-Godmer to be in distress and confined to an attic space where he posed no possible threat to the public, the force did not arrange for health care providers to be present to communicate with the man. Instead police engaged the victim immediately and shot him, killing him.</p>
<p>Few details have been released by the bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the relatively new agency that investigates cases of injuries or death involving police in the province. The bureau has assigned nine investigators to examine the case but has a curious policy of relying upon other police forces should they determine they need additional support. In this case they have said they will call upon the Montréal police. This raises real questions about the independence, autonomy, and, finally, legitimacy of any investigation undertaken under such circumstances.</p>

       *<p>Police in Canada kill a disproportionate number of people in mental distress. They continue to be deployed to engage with people experiencing mental distress despite the fact that history shows that police respond to those situations with a very quick use of lethal force.</p>
<p>In the case of the killing of Chad Murphy (45), it is estimated that from the moment Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers opened the door to Murphy’s basement apartment in Île-Perrot, it took only 30 seconds for police to fatally shoot him.</p>
<p>On Monday, February 12, 2018, Quebec’s director of criminal and penal prosecutions (DPCP) announced it will not be filing charges against any of the officers involved in shooting and killing Chad Murphy on October 2, 2016. The SQ had been notified by Murphy’s sister Sharon that he was distressed and suicidal after fleeing in anger from a family dispute. She said at the time that she made the call to get him help not to get him killed.</p>
<p>Officers allegedly tried to talk with Murphy through his apartment door before opening it with a key provided by a neighbor. The DPCP report says officers saw Murphy sitting on his living room floor with a knife in hand and when he saw the officers he started cutting himself. When he stood up and walked toward the door the police shot and killed him. Thirty seconds to interact with and kill a man.</p>
<p>The DPCP ruled that in shooting a man in distress who was harming himself, after only 30 seconds of interaction, the officers involved did not use excessive force and should not face criminal charges. The DPCP statement said: “A legally acceptable use of force is one that is not gratuitous and is applied in a measured way. The intervention was legal and is based primarily on the duty of the police officers to ensure the safety and security of others.” The report does not say that Murphy was using his knife in a way that threatened anyone other than himself. It does not say how many shots police fired.</p>
<p>This is pure propaganda, copaganda. Shooting someone in distress and harming only himself is described as measured. And it does not show how the safety and security of others, the public for example, was threatened. This decision is the state protecting the state.</p>
<p>The DPCP’s decision to not lay charges in the killing of Chad Murphy is based on the investigation by the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province. The BEI is not independent and relies on police forces for their forensic investigation.</p>
<p>Since June of 2016, the BEI has investigated 72 cases. This includes 37 fatal police interventions and four deaths that occurred during police detention. Of all of the investigations completed and turned over to prosecutors so far, <em>none</em> have led to charges against a single officer. The state does indeed protect the state.</p>

<p>On Friday night, September 30, 2016, police in Hamilton, Ontario shot and killed Anthony (Tony) Divers (36) a man who is reported to have been dealing with mental health issues. According to witnesses the victim had no weapon and posed no threat to police. He was apparently walking away from the Hamilton officers rather than toward them when they killed him.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines all cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario is investigating the killing. They have assigned seven investigators and three forensic investigators to review the killing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Tony Divers</p>
<p>Tony Divers was killed around 30 minutes after a 911 call was made about someone possibly hitting a woman. Someone may have reported seeing a gun but neither the police nor the SIU have revealed where that rumor originated and they have not confirmed the presence of any gun on or near the man they killed. A witnesses to the police killing of Tony Divers reports that he did not see the man carrying any gun.</p>
<p>One witness, Joe Towers recalls hering some noise behind him and someone shout “Fucking goof” (quoted in Bennett 2016). Looking further he noted a police officer following a civilian. What at first seemed like a routine arrest situation quickly turned when Towers heard the officer scream: “Get your fucking hands up” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). According to Towers, at this point he noticed that the officer had a gun drawn on the man (Bennett 2016b). Fearing being shot himself by police, Towers attempted to hide behind a trash dumpster when he heard the first shot fired by the cops. In his words: “It was sort of in mid-turn where I heard the first shot go off, and I was turning back, and I saw the second shot just hit the guy and the guy fell on the ground” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Several police then moved in to arrest the stricken man.</p>
<p>There remain some inconsistencies in the initial police reports. Divers was fatally shot less than 30 minutes after an assault took place that he was believed to have been involved in several blocks away. Police claim that the initial call for the assault came in around 11 PM, but time-stamped security footage from a condominium complex across the street places the initial encounter with the woman occurring at 11:34 PM. The killing of Tony Divers occurred close to midnight. Curiously the man in video footage, not confirmed to be Divers was wearing a “security” shirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mental Health, Policing, and the Killing of Tony Divers</p>
<p>A Hamilton defense lawyer who has represented Tony Divers since 2011 says that the young man had been struggling with mental health issues in the period before he was killed by police. She suggests he might have been seeking help the night he was killed. According to lawyer Jaime Stephenson: “Recently he’s been dealing with some mental health issues. He’d been intermittently seeking treatment for that” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). She notes that the location at which Divers was killed by police might give “an indication of where he was headed” at the time, possibly to the psychiatric emergency room at Hamilton’s St. Joseph’s Healthcare (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In her view: “He was awfully close to St. Joe’s. I wasn’t there, obviously. But my suspicion is that he may have been seeking treatment” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). While Stephenson did not know of any specific diagnosis for Divers she was aware that he was receiving “some treatment” for a mental health issue (quoted in Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>A friend, who would identify himself only as Daniel, remembered Tony Divers as “a very loving and caring brother and friend and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do to help those he cared about” (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016). The mourning friend expressed the sense of loss:</p>
<p>“He is going to be sadly and deeply missed by many whose lives he brightened and affected. I’m personally so deeply heartbroken and lost over this. He was always there for me and carried me through some of my hardest times. Times I’d not have made it through without his love, support, and guidance.” (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016)</p>
<p>These are the people killed by police who are trained to see not human beings but only threats. And to see them everywhere, in everyone. And often that “threat” can be as little as refusing to follow orders shouted in anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die</p>
<p>According to witness Joe Towers, Tony Divers was actually walking away from police when they shot him. This raises again the question of “comply or die policing” and the killing of a civilian not because they pose a threat but simply because they have ignored or questioned an officer’s authority.</p>
<p>Based on what he saw he did not believe Divers was armed. According to Towers: “I didn’t see him waving any gun around” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). This case appears to have been another case of “comply or die policing,” an all too common occurrence in the Canadian context, based on the witness report. Notably, while suggesting that Divers was not necessarily cooperative, he did not appear to pose a real threat. In Towers’ view: “He didn’t look very afraid of the cop; he wasn&#8217;t being cooperative, but he didn’t look like he was any particular threat. It just didn’t seem like he wanted to be arrested” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). And this is a reasonable enough position for any citizen to take. It should not cost one one’s life. Under conditions of comply or die policing simply not wanting to be arrested, or questioning why one is being engaged by police can be an executable offense.</p>
<p>Witness Joe Towers recalls the officer being close to the victim, in his estimation “a few feet, not very far at all” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In Towers’ view there was no need to use deadly force and given how close the officer was to the victim he believes a taser could have been deployed instead. Hamilton police are among the first police agencies in the province to arm all front line officers with tasers following a 2013 decision by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services to ease restrictions on who can use them (Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>Towers was understandably upset by witnessing the police killing of Divers and he questioned why police came at the man with guns drawn at all. Towers stated afterwards: “My only concern was why the gun was drawn on him in the first place. Perhaps [the cop] was told that he had a gun by somebody else, but I don’t know” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). The question has been raised by others concerned about the police killing of Divers. Lawyer Jaime Stephenson questions the police response in this case. In her words: “I query why deadly force was used. Even if there was some report on a 9-1-1 call that there was a weapon, if you’re there and you don’t see a weapon …” (quoted in Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>Another witness, taxi driver Khalid Yousaf, told the Hamilton Spectator Friday night following the shooting that he saw a man, presumably Tony Driver, walking on James Street South and then heard a police officer tell the man to stop walking (Bennett 2016a). Yousaf reported that while the man kept walking the officer followed him again asking him to stop walking. Rather shockingly Yousaf revealed that “the man turned to face the officer and stretched out his arms at his side and palms facing the officer” (quoted in Bennett 2016a). So by his eyewitness account the man killed by police posed no threat and indeed showed the police his open palms, holding nothing. Then, for this, he was shot twice and killed. According to Khalid Yousaf: “Then, he fired” (quoted in Bennett 2016a). Yousaf never reported seeing the victim with a gun at any point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In reflecting upon the history of police killings of civilians dealing with mental health issues, Stephenson suggests: “It doesn’t seem like the police are learning from the past mistakes that have happened” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Sadly police killings in Canada suggest these cases will continue to occur as police insist on pursuing comply or die policing approaches. This is underlined by the fact that because police are never held truly accountable for killing civilians there is no reason for them to change their approach and behavior. And there remains no mechanism for holding them fully accountable.</p>

       *<p>Family and loved ones of Tony Divers have been kept in the dark about the SIU investigation into the police killing of the 36-year-old Hamilton man. On Thursday, August 10, 2017, they received the awful news that the Special Investigations Unit  has cleared the Hamilton officer who shot Tony Divers will not be charged. The decision comes 10 months after the killing on September 30, 2017, a too long period of time in which questions from the family have not been properly addressed.</p>
<p>The officer responsible fired two shots at the unarmed Divers, with one bullet hitting the victim in the chest. Despite the fact that Divers was unarmed, SIU Director Tony Loparco concluded the officer was justified in believing his own life was at risk and in fearing that Divers was armed. Under Loparco the already questionable SIU has become something of a legitimation mechanism for cops who kill civilians.</p>
<p>Yvonne Alexander, Tony Divers’ sister, and a tireless advocate for information and justice, responded with the pained honesty of someone whose loved one has been killed by police: “I’m shocked but I&#8217;m not at all surprised. Because it seems to be the norm these days for officers to shoot and kill someone in mental crisis&#8221; (quoted in Bennett 2017).</p>
<p>Of particular concern for observers is the report that the call to police included a claim that Divers was  “anti-police.” Did this play into the quick resort to lethal force by Hamilton police?</p>
<p>This is reinforced by Loparco’s  conclusion in the case: “On all of the information that the [officer] had in his possession at the time he shot and killed Mr. Divers, I find that the [officer], subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that his life was at risk from Mr. Divers” (quoted in Bennett 2017). Because he was said to be “anti-police?”</p>
<p>Loparco continues: “I find in all the circumstances, that despite the after the fact knowledge that Mr. Divers was not armed, the [officer] reasonably believed that his life was in danger from Mr. Divers and his actions in firing upon Mr. Divers were justified” (quoted in Bennett 2017). This is in keeping with other SIU findings under Loparco.</p>
<p>Loparco further notes in his report that the officer who shot Tony Divers had had previous contact with the victim and considered him “anti-police and very violent” (quoted in Bennett 2017). The officer actually appears to have held several prejudices against Tony Divers, including the assumptions that he was involved in organized crime and a drug user. The SIU report does not delve into these issues in probing detail.</p>
<p>The family says that Tony Divers was struggling with mental health issues when the officer shot him. For the family, this did not matter to police who responded to their loved one through the prejudging lens that held him as simply a thug.</p>
<p>Edward Divers, the victim&#8217;s brother, said the decision and explanation for why the shooting is justified felt to him like &#8220;an eye for an eye,&#8221; that his brother was treated as a &#8220;violent thug&#8221; with no regard for his mental illness.</p>
<p>One eyewitness, who says he did not see Divers holding any weapon, also said the victim appeared to pose no threat to anyone. Yet he did note that Divers did not seem subservient to the officer, a situation that seems to provoke police violence (respect their authority or die). According to witness Joe Towers: “He didn’t look very afraid of the cop; he wasn’t being cooperative, but he didn’t look like he was any particular threat. It just didn’t seem like he wanted to be arrested” (quoted in Bennett 2017).</p>

       *<p>The lack of effective and independent oversight of police is an ongoing issue in the Canadian context. This is true even where supposedly independent investigations units exist provincially. In every case investigations are impeded by police harassment, non-cooperation, and/or intimidation. In addition their is no mechanism to force police to comply with or adhere to investigation procedures. In many cases investigating agencies have connections with police forces, including dependence of police for their own training. This all means that there is no proper oversight of police in Canada and families are often doubly victimized, first by the taking of a loved one by police and then by a process that excludes them and lacks efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p>One issue being raised by families of victims of police killings in Ontario is with the slow pace of investigations and the lack of information provided publicly and to families. This has been a concern for the main police oversight body in the province, the Special Investigations Unit (considered the gold standard globally, which says plenty)</p>
<p>Growing attention and increasing public outcry in Canada over police killings of civilians has led to an independent review of police oversight in Ontario. One issue examined is the matter of public release of information from SIU investigations. The final report from Justice Michael Tulloch on police oversight in Ontario is slated to be released in March.</p>
<p>The family of Tony Divers (36) has been waiting for answers since their loved one was shot and killed by Hamilton Police on September 30, 2016. The family says it was told that forensics and toxicology work was done in December but it could still take several months several months before the SIU release any information about the investigation. Incredibly, in the meantime, Edward Divers, the victim’s brother, was arrested on an old warrant when he attended a Police Services Board meeting and raised questions about the killing of his brother. This has been viewed as a punitive act of harassment by police.</p>
<p>Police have said they were responding to a call when they targeted Divers. Yet no details have been released about the call or who made it. In addition police have claimed the victim had a gun, yet there is no evidence available that suggests any gun, or any other weapon, was present at the scene apart from police weapons. At least one witness has said that Divers did not have any gun at the scene.</p>
<p>The family says Divers was struggling with mental health issues at the time police killed him. The use of lethal force by police against people experiencing mental health crises has become a too common situation in Canada. So too is the stonewalling of family requests for basic information and insight into the police killings of their loved ones.</p>
<p>Karyn Greenwood-Graham, whose son was killed by Waterloo Police almost a decade ago, points to what she calls the “police culture” that dominates throughout the SIU. In her words: “What we have seen is a lack of support, a lack of respect, a lack of acknowledgement to the families who have lost a loved one, a son, a brother” (quoted in Bennett 2017). Greenwood-Graham organizes with the Affected Families of Police Homicide provides solidarity and support for families of victims of police killings of civilians</p>
<p>The slow process of investigations raises questions about transparency and credibility. It also leaves families in turmoil, harming their health and well being.</p>

       *<p>Police are vindictive. This characteristic of vindictiveness comes to the fore powerfully, along with other regulars secretiveness, defensiveness, and self-righteousness in situations where police respond to critics when they have killed someone. This vindictiveness was clearly on display on January 12 in Hamilton, Ontario when police arrested Edward Divers moments after he made a presentation at the Hamilton Police Services Board critical of police actions in the killing of his brother Tony Divers in September of 2016.</p>
<p>This vindictiveness is emphasized by the fact that Edward Divers was arrested on an 11-year-old warrant for a failure to appear. The use of failure to appear charges to criminalize people is a scandal in Canada where it is routinely laid against poor, homeless, and street involved people who may lack resources to ensure appearances at court appointed times or who have irregular schedules. Growing numbers of people are being detained solely on the basis of failure to appear charges. In the Divers case the Crown actively opposed his release but he was finally released on bail.</p>
<p>The family believes they have been specifically targeted by police. And any observer might well ask why and under what circumstances the police investigated Divers and came across the decade-old warrant. A reasonable conclusion is that they went searching for anything on Edward Divers knowing of his criticisms of police and intention to present at the Police Board meeting.</p>
<p>Divers has been living with sisters in Hamilton since October 2016, shortly after his brother’s killing. Despite this he was not arrested until he came forward to criticize police and made application to speak at the Police Board. Divers criticism ahs extended to the chief who he has suggested acts more like a politician than a human in addressing police use of lethal force.</p>
<p>Police Board member Councillor Terry Whitehead, justified police by saying blandly: “They have a responsibility to protect the public” (quoted in Bennett 2017). Yet it is not clear how the public is in need of protection for a failure to appear.</p>
<p>Divers’ sister, Yvonne Alexander described the operations police put in place to apprehend the failure to appear suspect. In her words: “They had police at every exit unbeknownst to us during the meeting. Then as soon as we walked over the threshold out of city hall, five cops arrested him. They wouldn’t tell us why” (quoted in Bennett 2017).</p>
<p>We can surmise that it had everything to do with a grieving brother simply daring to question a force that has killed his brother. And which is used to acting vindictively, viciously, with impunity. They do it because they can.</p>

       *<p>As is true of police killings of civilians in the United States, Canadian police disproportionately kill people experiencing mental health issues (police in Canada also disproportionately kill Black and Indigenous people). Too often, police insisting on a “comply or die” framework for encountering civilians quickly act with lethal force against people unwilling or unable to accept orders from officers.</p>
<p>On Friday night, September 30, 2016, police in Hamilton, Ontario shot and killed Anthony (Tony) Divers (36) a man who is reported to have been dealing with mental health issues. According to witnesses the victim had no weapon and posed no threat to police. He was apparently walking away from the Hamilton officers rather than toward them when they killed him.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines all cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario is investigating the killing. They have assigned seven investigators and three forensic investigators to review the killing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Tony Divers</p>
<p>Tony Divers was killed around 30 minutes after a 911 call was made about someone possibly hitting a woman. Someone may have reported seeing a gun but neither the police nor the SIU have revealed where that rumor originated and they have not confirmed the presence of any gun on or near the man they killed. A witnesses to the police killing of Tony Divers reports that he did not see the man carrying any gun.</p>
<p>One witness, Joe Towers recalls hering some noise behind him and someone shout “Fucking goof” (quoted in Bennett 2016). Looking further he noted a police officer following a civilian. What at first seemed like a routine arrest situation quickly turned when Towers heard the officer scream: “Get your fucking hands up” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). According to Towers, at this point he noticed that the officer had a gun drawn on the man (Bennett 2016b). Fearing being shot himself by police, Towers attempted to hide behind a trash dumpster when he heard the first shot fired by the cops. In his words: “It was sort of in mid-turn where I heard the first shot go off, and I was turning back, and I saw the second shot just hit the guy and the guy fell on the ground” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Several police then moved in to arrest the stricken man.</p>
<p>There remain some inconsistencies in the initial police reports. Divers was fatally shot less than 30 minutes after an assault took place that he was believed to have been involved in several blocks away. Police claim that the initial call for the assault came in around 11 PM, but time-stamped security footage from a condominium complex across the street places the initial encounter with the woman occurring at 11:34 PM. The killing of Tony Divers occurred close to midnight. Curiously the man in video footage, not confirmed to be Divers was wearing a “security” shirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mental Health, Policing, and the Killing of Tony Divers</p>
<p>A Hamilton defense lawyer who has represented Tony Divers since 2011 says that the young man had been struggling with mental health issues in the period before he was killed by police. She suggests he might have been seeking help the night he was killed. According to lawyer Jaime Stephenson: “Recently he’s been dealing with some mental health issues. He’d been intermittently seeking treatment for that” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). She notes that the location at which Divers was killed by police might give “an indication of where he was headed” at the time, possibly to the psychiatric emergency room at Hamilton’s St. Joseph’s Healthcare (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In her view: “He was awfully close to St. Joe’s. I wasn’t there, obviously. But my suspicion is that he may have been seeking treatment” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). While Stephenson did not know of any specific diagnosis for Divers she was aware that he was receiving “some treatment” for a mental health issue (quoted in Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>A friend, who would identify himself only as Daniel, remembered Tony Divers as “a very loving and caring brother and friend and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do to help those he cared about” (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016). The mourning friend expressed the sense of loss:</p>
<p>“He is going to be sadly and deeply missed by many whose lives he brightened and affected. I’m personally so deeply heartbroken and lost over this. He was always there for me and carried me through some of my hardest times. Times I’d not have made it through without his love, support, and guidance.” (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016)</p>
<p>These are the people killed by police who are trained to see not human beings but only threats. And to see them everywhere, in everyone. And often that “threat” can be as little as refusing to follow orders shouted in anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die</p>
<p>According to witness Joe Towers, Tony Divers was actually walking away from police when they shot him. This raises again the question of “comply or die policing” and the killing of a civilian not because they pose a threat but simply because they have ignored or questioned an officer’s authority.</p>
<p>Based on what he saw he did not believe Divers was armed. According to Towers: “I didn’t see him waving any gun around” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). This case appears to have been another case of “comply or die policing,” an all too common occurrence in the Canadian context, based on the witness report. Notably, while suggesting that Divers was not necessarily cooperative, he did not appear to pose a real threat. In Towers’ view: “He didn’t look very afraid of the cop; he wasn&#8217;t being cooperative, but he didn’t look like he was any particular threat. It just didn’t seem like he wanted to be arrested” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). And this is a reasonable enough position for any citizen to take. It should not cost one one’s life. Under conditions of comply or die policing simply not wanting to be arrested, or questioning why one is being engaged by police can be an executable offense.</p>
<p>Witness Joe Towers recalls the officer being close to the victim, in his estimation “a few feet, not very far at all” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In Towers’ view there was no need to use deadly force and given how close the officer was to the victim he believes a taser could have been deployed instead. Hamilton police are among the first police agencies in the province to arm all front line officers with tasers following a 2013 decision by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services to ease restrictions on who can use them (Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>Towers was understandably upset by witnessing the police killing of Divers and he questioned why police came at the man with guns drawn at all. Towers stated afterwards: “My only concern was why the gun was drawn on him in the first place. Perhaps [the cop] was told that he had a gun by somebody else, but I don’t know” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). The question has been raised by others concerned about the police killing of Divers. Lawyer Jaime Stephenson questions the police response in this case. In her words: “I query why deadly force was used. Even if there was some report on a 9-1-1 call that there was a weapon, if you’re there and you don’t see a weapon …” (quoted in Bennett 2016b).</p>
<p>Another witness, taxi driver Khalid Yousaf, told the Hamilton Spectator Friday night following the shooting that he saw a man, presumably Tony Driver, walking on James Street South and then heard a police officer tell the man to stop walking (Bennett 2016a). Yousaf reported that while the man kept walking the officer followed him again asking him to stop walking. Rather shockingly Yousaf revealed that “the man turned to face the officer and stretched out his arms at his side and palms facing the officer” (quoted in Bennett 2016a). So by his eyewitness account the man killed by police posed no threat and indeed showed the police his open palms, holding nothing. Then, for this, he was shot twice and killed. According to Khalid Yousaf: “Then, he fired” (quoted in Bennett 2016a). Yousaf never reported seeing the victim with a gun at any point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In reflecting upon the history of police killings of civilians dealing with mental health issues, Stephenson suggests: “It doesn’t seem like the police are learning from the past mistakes that have happened” (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Sadly police killings in Canada suggest these cases will continue to occur as police insist on pursuing comply or die policing approaches. This is underlined by the fact that because police are never held truly accountable for killing civilians there is no reason for them to change their approach and behavior. And there remains no mechanism for holding them fully accountable.</p>

The killing took place in the town of St-Cyrille-de-Wendover, near Drummondville, about 115 kilometers northeast of Montréal after two SQ officers apparently responded to a call at approximately 9:45 PM.

<p>Six investigators with the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the Bureau of Independent Investigators, which investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Québec, are investigating the killing of the as yet unnamed victim.

On Thursday, June 15, 2017 The Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions for the province announced its decision not to lay charges against the officers responsible. The Lac-Simon force was not investigated by an independent body but  rather by Montreal police who made the recommendation, not surprisingly, not to lay charges.</p>
<p>Four officers had been sent to Michel’s home, in the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon in western Quebec just south of Val-d&#8217;Or, apparently in response to a domestic call. Police claim to have approached Michel on the basis that he was known to them. The police report says Michel exited his house carrying a machete but notes that officers drove into him with their police car. No statement on whether or not this is standard and sanctioned police procedure. Yet the Montreal police did suggest that it was legal activity with which the Director agreed with. When this did not give them the desired result an officer fired four shots and killed the man.</p>
<p>Since this investigation was begun Quebec has established an oversight body the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations). Only two days before the Lac-Simon announcement, critics held a press conference claiming the BEI was neither transparent nor effective.</p>

The names of some of the victims, such as Presley Leslie, Marcellus Francois, and Alain Magloire, give testimony to that fact. That is only part of the story as Black residents regularly speak out against racial profiling and violence directed against them by Montreal police. It is important to note, then, that the 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police on June 27, 2017, has been identified as a Black man by the BEI (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec. The victim has not yet been named.</p>
<p>The killing again raises many questions about the Montreal police force (though racism and regular deployment of lethal force are standards of police forces across Canada at municipal, provincial, and federal levels). As Fo Niemi, the executive director of Montreal’s Centre for Research Action on Race Relations, suggests: “It raises the question, ‘where do we go from here?’ Is this a case where race plays a role in this incident? Is it mental health? I think there are a lot of questions here that need to be asked because this is not a situation that should occur too often in this city” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Before being shot the man had only been suggested to be breaking things in his apartment. Surely not a capital, or even particularly harmful “offense.” As community activist Will Prosper, a former RCMP officer, puts it the man appears not have been “presenting a menace to anyone except to his apartment” (quoted in CBC News 2017). Yet police moved to coercive, then lethal means. Questions must be asked about the role of racism, or implicit bias, in this.</p>
<p>Critics note that police use of threatening behavior and the display of weapons will only make the situation worse in a case of someone experiencing mental distress or already feeling anxious and defensive. As Prosper suggests: “That’s not what you need to preserve the life of the citizen. It’s going to do the [complete opposite], and I think that’s probably what happened in this case” (quoted in CBC News 2017). In Prosper’s view, the man could have benefited from someone talking to and calming him down without the presence of weapons. In Prosper’s words: “If you&#8217;re saying ‘calm down’ and you have the gun pointed at his face, that’s not going to work” (quoted in CBC News 2017). This is why police should not be sent in such cases in place of health care providers (if anyone needs to be sent for smashing dishes at home at all).</p>
<p>Police racism and the killings of Black men have received too little public attention and ire. These realities have been ideologically downplayed by governments at all levels. They have also been distorted and denied by police officers, forces, and associations. Criminologists in Canada have also done too little to expose and challenge these issues, too often playing the part of police apologists. Black Lives Matter activists and movements have done much work to shift understandings in the Canadian context.</p>

       ***<p>Montreal police shot and killed a 58-year-old man in the mid-evening of June 27, 2017 outside his home. The man was shot multiple times by police at about 7:19 PM after they were apparently called out because the victim was said to be committing the high crime of destroying things in his own apartment near the corner of Robillard and St-André streets. Police claim they used a taser and rubber bullets on the man before deciding they needed to kill him.</p>
<p>City ambulance services have reported that the victim was in cardiac arrest when he was transported to hospital. The BEI (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec, is investigating.</p>
       ***<p>Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert, who killed Bony Jean-Pierre (46) in April 2016, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge against him. Gilbert shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a plastic bullet during a raid. The killing of Jean-Pierre sparked an uprising in the Montreal North Neighborhood where the shooting happened. The charge against officer Gilbert represents only the ninth time since 1999 that an officer has been charged in the injuring or killing of a civilian in Quebec.</p>
<p>Gilbert was not present in court for the July 6, 2017 appearance.  His defence lawyer Isabelle Briand also informed the court that Gilbert wants a trial by judge and jury. Gilbert’s next court date is scheduled for August 29, 2017.</p>
       ***<p>An intersection of racism, poverty, mental health distress, and police violence has once again had a  deadly outcome. The 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police has been identified as Pierre Coriolan, a Black male of Haitian background who was know to suffer mental health issues. It has now been further revealed that Coriolan was facing eviction from the apartment he had been living in since 2008 on July 1, 2017, and that this had understandably greatly distressed him. The eviction order was issued against Mr. Coriolan by the Quebec rental board on June 1 according to Claudine Laurin, director general of la Fédération des OSBL d’habitation de Montréal, an organization of subsidized housing apartments. That a subsidized housing association would evict someone over mental health issues is troubling.</p>
<p>Police were supposedly responding to a call that Mr. Coriolan was breaking things in his apartment when they showed up and shot him. It has not been stated publicly why police chose to shoot someone multiple times for smashing his apartment but the earlier mentioned intersectional factors offer something of an answer, particularly the engrained violence of police. When Urgence-Santé arrived at the scene of the shooting around 7:30 PM, Mr. Coriolan was in cardiac arrest. He was taken to hospital and died at about 9:45 PM.</p>
<p>Neighbors have said that they sometimes heard Mr. Coriolan screaming and plates breaking in the apartment but insist that he did not bother them and they understood that he was not well. They did not fear him and were not disturbed by him. Neighbors expressed shock over the police actions.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening of October 2 the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) responded to a phone call apparently from a man in Île-Perrot threatening to kill himself. Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.</p>
<p>Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Québec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.</p>
<p>Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Québec Police Killing People in Distress</p>
<p>A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the École nationale de police du Québec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Québec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims “in an altered state of consciousness” (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Québec study. And they lack proper training.</p>
<p>To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was “suicide by cop” an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.</p>

       ***<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>
       ***<p>Police should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues. This is becoming increasingly clear to many as such situations almost inevitably seem to end with the distressed person being killed by cops conditioned to expect the worst in everyone or trained to act on a “comply or die” basis in which any affront to their authority is grounds for immediate execution. Police forces across Canada are killing people experiencing distress on a regular basis. And so often they do so in cases where the distressed person is confined to an indoor setting posing no possible threat to the public. And usually no health care support personnel (doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, etc.) are involved.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 6, 2016, Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police officers shot and killed 29-year-old Danny Lafrance-Godmer during a police invasion of a home on Saint François Xavier Street in Montebello, Québec. Police were apparently responding to a call about a man in distress. They entered the home, eventually going into the attic where they encountered the man identified now as Danny Lafrance-Godmer. It is not clear why, given that police knew Lafrance-Godmer to be in distress and confined to an attic space where he posed no possible threat to the public, the force did not arrange for health care providers to be present to communicate with the man. Instead police engaged the victim immediately and shot him, killing him.</p>
<p>Few details have been released by the bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the relatively new agency that investigates cases of injuries or death involving police in the province. The bureau has assigned nine investigators to examine the case but has a curious policy of relying upon other police forces should they determine they need additional support. In this case they have said they will call upon the Montréal police. This raises real questions about the independence, autonomy, and, finally, legitimacy of any investigation undertaken under such circumstances.</p>

According to the BEI, police responded to a call regarding a man experiencing some distress in the center of a street. The BEI states that the responding officer activated the flashing lights of the cruiser which caused the man to panic and run. After a foot chase that ended in a parking lot the officer shot the man. The SQ claim the man had a knife. None of the details have been independently confirmed. Eight BEI investigators have been assigned to the case and will examine the SQ version of events. The BEI is not an independent unit though and Montreal police will assist them in this investigation, which leaves police investigating police.</p>

Following the killing there were calls to identify the officers involved and charge them and to release video footage of the interaction and shooting. As one close friend of Andrew Loku, Kiden Jonathan, who had been with his friend hours before he was killed, has said publicly: “We had a lot of questions, and we didn’t have any answers about what happened that night” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Calls for an inquest in the killing of Andrew Loku have come from many different sources. These include members of Loku’s family, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the African Canadian Legal Clinic, Alok Mukherjee, former chair of the Toronto Police Service Board, and Black Lives Matter Toronto.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest into Loku’s killing will be presided over by coroner Dr. John Carlisle. Several community groups have sought participant status in the inquest. They include the CMHA, the Black Action Defence Committee, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Empowerment Council, and Across Boundaries, a groups provides support and services to racialized communities dealing with mental health issues (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Accountability: A Flawed SIU Investigation</p>
<p>While there should be no illusions about the coroner’s inquest, and its limited scope of action, it is hoped that the inquest will provide some answers to serious questions about Andrew Loku’s killing. These include the identities of the two officers directly involved.</p>
<p>The officer who killed Loku had already been exonerated by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines police harm to civilians in Ontario, in March 2016. The SIU declared the shooting “legally justified,” a typical response to police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>This decision drew outrage from community members, policing critics, and Black Lives Matter organizers. A space in front of Toronto Police Headquarters was occupied following the decision to clear the officer who killed Loku. Black Lives Matter Toronto held the space for 15 days in protest against ongoing racism, lack of transparency, and lack of accountability in both policing and oversight. Community members also held a vigil outside the home of Premier Kathleen Wynne, head of provincial government.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the SIU claim that the officer who killed Loku was worried about a hammer Loku was said to be holding, evidence suggests another story. Steve Lurie, Executive Director of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Toronto, has called for the inquest based on evidence that contradicts the SIU and police story. In his words: “We have evidence that Andrew was calm at the time of his shooting” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Two issues call into question the conclusions of the SIU. First is the actual account of an eye witness who has said that Loku did not pose any threat to anyone at the time of his killing. According to Loku’s neighbor, Robin Hicks, who witnessed the police killing: “Andrew died right in front of me. There was no reason for it” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Second are the serious questions about surveillance video from the shooting.  According to police and the SIU, the video cameras at the scene were not functioning that night, and, even more curious, cut out right in the crucial moment before Loku is shot by the officer (Gillis 2017a). The video that does exist apparently shows Loku moving very slowly with the hammer down at his side, his behavior in no way threatening.</p>
<p>As troubling is the fact that Immediately after the shooting, a Toronto police officer tried to review and download the video (Gillis 2017a). Incredibly, this is activity that even the SIU called “improper” yet they did not probe this further in their investigation. This is more evidence of the ongoing, and unpunished, practices of police to interfere with, obstruct, and predetermine the SIU investigations. The SIU have themselves long documented and complained about such practices but there are no mechanisms used to make police comply with investigative policies and procedures (legal mechanisms ate available but are, again, rarely if ever used to hold police accountable).</p>
<p>The SIU’s decision renewed ongoing concerns about police oversight in Ontario. The SIU is lauded by government proponents as the “gold standard” of police oversight internationally. Yet SIU investigations have been undermined by obstruction and harassment from police, which are not properly dealt with, and plagued by a repeated lack of transparency regarding decision-making and real questions about the degree to which officers have actually been held accountable (Gillis 2017a). These problem have been documented in detail within this project.</p>
<p>So questionable was the SIU decision in this case that it, along with the community protests, contributed to the initiation of the provincial review of police oversight by Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch, which made recommendations around transparency and police compliance. Public concern over the case led to the unprecedented release in 2016 of the SIU director’s report into Loku’s killing. Yet that document was heavily redacted and not particularly insightful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intersections of State Violence: Police, Racism, and Mental Health</p>
<p>Toward the end of 2016 a coalition of community groups sent a letter to presiding coroner Carlisle requesting that he broaden the scope of the inquest to examine the intersecting roles of race and mental in the officer’s quick decision to view Loku as a threat and to kill him. The November 2016 submission by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Law Union of Ontario, Ryerson University’s criminology department and others notes that the inquest cannot hope to live up to its stated purpose of preventing future deaths if, in their words “Mr. Loku’s race, immigration and mental health status are kept out of the inquest process” (quoted in Gillis 2017a). Unfortunately coroner’s inquests are rather functional, examining specific circumstances of a particular death and do not analyse broader systemic issues of inequality and injustice as are in fact crucial to understanding state violence.</p>
<p>Some groups have requested standing in the inquest in order to raise significant questions about race and mental health that would otherwise be overlooked by such an inquest. Howard Morton, lawyer for the group Across Boundaries, explains that if granted status the group hopes to examine key issues of intersectionality. In particular there is a need to address why Black men who are suffering from mental health issues are so often the victims of fatal encounters with police officers (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In fact, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) leased units inside the building in which Loku was killed. The apartments provide housing for people with mental health challenges. The inquest should, at minimum, address the extent to which police officers were aware that Loku’s address was connected to the CMHA, an indication that some residents deal with mental health challenges (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In the words of Kingsley Gilliam, a spokesperson for the Black Action Defence Committee, outside the courtroom on Monday: “He did not need to die. We need a shift in paradigm, where we shift crisis intervention away from police” (quoted in Gillis 2017b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Inquest</p>
<p>The inquest, with a jury of five members, is slated to last three weeks and hear from around 20 witnesses. The inquest has no powers and will simply make recommendations to prevent similar deaths. These are typically ignored or selectively implemented, but not necessarily practiced after implementation, by police. There can be no criminal findings and no charges can result. No findings for compensation can be offered. Inquests can lead to the naming of killer cops and are some of the only, very limited, means for doing so in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>Expectations for the inquest should be tempered given its limited scope and powers. There have already been numerous inquests into police violence and the killing of civilians. All that they have really done is to highlight that the police in Canada are brutal and kill a stunningly large number of people. And they kill Black people and people dealing with mental health issues with haste.</p>
<p>The previous inquests have made recommendations around increased de-escalation training and reducing stigmatization for people dealing with mental health issues. Training has not translated into action and, really, serves largely as window dressing for police forces and means of extra pay for officers. And, of course, we can never forget that police are instituted and officers paid to kill.</p>

       ***<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is investigating after an Ottawa police officer was involved in an exchange in which two people were killed and one left injured. The details of the killings have not been released publicly but it has been reported by the SIU that a 31-year-old man was killed during an exchange of gunfire with police and another man, 43 years old, was killed during the police pursuit. None of these reports have been independently confirmed. The incident is said to have taken place around 2 AM on the morning of Saturday, June 3 in Ottawa’s popular downtown Byward Market area, a tourist destination not far from the Parliament buildings. The 31-year-old victim was chased by the police officer into a parking garage before he was killed. The injured man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Mathieu Fleury, the city councillor for the market area, wasted no time in playing up the drugs and gangs panics that are often trotted out to justify police violence. In a written statement provided to CBC News, Fleury said the incident “is reflective of the drug and gang activity across our city” (quoted in 2017). This is nothing more than crass fear politics and there is so far nothing to suggest it has any relation to the present case. Neither the SIU nor the Ottawa police have claimed that the Saturday shootings are in any way drug or gang related. The claim is not new though and has been used by the Calgary police chief to justify multiple police killings of civilians in that city (even where they have nothing to do with drugs or gangs).</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned 10 officers to the investigation: three investigators and seven forensics investigators. In addition to the subject officer, two witness officers from the Ottawa police have been identified.</p>

       ***<p>A 2017 Toronto police report on Taser use in 2016 claims that no one died from Tasers in 2016 despite the fact that the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines police harm to civilians, is still investigating the death of 31-year-old Rui Nabico. On November 4, 2016, Nabico went into medical distress after Toronto police fired a stun gun at him. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The young man only went into medical distress after being Tasered so the Toronto police report is clearly false. A piece of copaganda.</p>
       ***<p>The Toronto police officers who killed Andrew Loku on July 5, 2015, have finally been identified as Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub. They were named as the officer’s involved on July 9, 2017, during the coroner’s  inquest into Loku’s killing when police lawyer Gary Clewley asked the men to rise from their seats to be identified by a witness. Even now, however, it was not said which of the two officers shot Loku. That identification is, after all this time, expected to come during the second week of the inquest when the officers are set to testify.</p>
<p>Video surveillance footage of events prior to the shooting of Loku in the hallway outside his apartment shows that he was not threatening his neighbors as he has been accused of. The neighbors do not appear afraid of him and some speak with him though there is no audio in the footage. Neighbor and witness Robin Hicks claimed on the stand that she was afraid <em>for</em> Loku not <em>of</em> Loku when police arrived. The footage also shows Loku holding a hammer in a manner that does not appear to be threatening (not fully by the handle).</p>
<p>Still, police shot and killed Andrew Loku within 19 seconds of encountering him and within only five minutes of the 911 call that apparently brought them. Because the state protects the state, the killer cops Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub have already been cleared by the Special Investigations Unit.</p>
       ***<p>The coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Andrew Loku began in Toronto on Monday, June 5, 2017. Loku, a 45-year-old refugee from South Sudan who struggled with mental health issues after having been kidnapped and tortured there, was shot and killed by Toronto police as he stood in his apartment hallway on July 5, 2015. On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the 911 call that preceded his killing was released as part of the inquest.</p>
<p>The call reveals that police waited no more than 19 seconds after encountering Loku before shooting and killing him. He had stood in the hallway without harming anyone for at least four minutes and forty seconds before police arrived. The two officers, one a coach and the other a new recruit with only a few months on the job, are immediately heard on the tape telling Loku to drop his perceived weapon, a hammer he held at his side.  Indistinct noises, mostly yelling by police, follow over the 19 seconds. And then. Two very distinct gunshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 caller, distraught: “Oh, my god. Oh, my god.”</p>
<p>The 911 operator: “What was that?”</p>
<p>The caller: “That was gunshots. Gunshots from the police officer.”</p>
<p>A male voice then breaks through telling everyone to stay in their apartments. This is repeated by the operator.</p>
<p>Then the caller, in pained recognition: “They killed him?”</p>
<p>The operator: “Oh, my. What?”</p>
<p>Then, sadly, a child, softly: “He’s dead?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, violent force was first and foremost on the officers’ minds. There was no, even minimal, attempt to interact humanly with Andrew Loku. Never mind de-escalation, because the police were the only ones to escalate in the first place. Nineteen seconds was all they gave him.</p>
       ***<p>Devon LaFleur, a young man struggling with mental health issues, was killed by Toronto police who had been informed of his mental illness and of the fact that the “weapon” he held was a broken pellet gun that did not work. His family had shared that information with Ottawa police who contacted Toronto police about the young man. Still police rained down at least 21 bullets on him striking him eight times. On June 6, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) ruled, incredibly, that despite this Toronto police were “more than justified” in killing LaFleur. <em>More than justified</em>.</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s mother, attributes the killing of her son to a failure of communication by police and inadequate, improper, or insufficient training of police in interacting with people experiencing mental health issues. LaFleur had schizophrenia and was apparently not on his medication the night police killed him.</p>
<p>According to Rena LaFleur, police disregarded the information they had, instead choosing to take a typically aggressive and confrontational approach with the young man. In her words:</p>
<p>“They created a situation in which they were confronting [him]. I can’t see how they can possibly justify that that is a viable mental health protocol. It&#8217;s shameful. I find it&#8217;s just a shame and many more people are going to die, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur reveals that she had spoken with police about her son’s situation and there was a plan to have plainclothes Toronto officers attend the home of a friend with whom Devon LaFleur was meeting. She suggests: “They had a lot of time. They had what seemed to be a good plan in place and they changed it at the last minute” (quoted in 2017). She does not know why.</p>
<p>What did happen is that four uniformed police officers arrived at the friend’s house in marked cruisers. Officers yelled at the distressed man throughout the encounter and drew their guns on him. According to the SIU one officer fired 12 to 13 shots, the second fired eight to nine shots, while the third fired one bullet.</p>
<p>Sascha LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s sister suggests: “So how do you say [we’ll shoot] to somebody who’s in psychosis, that believes that the angels will protect him from the bullets. You’re provoking him. There needs to be other methods of de-escalation, not lethal force, because you can’t come back from that” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>As Rena LaFleur puts it, painfully directly: “He didn’t have to die” (quoted in 2017).</p>

       ***<p>Toronto area police have killed several people in the past few years for holding or being near BB guns. Over the past year alone, two Ontario coroner’s inquests and one SIU investigation have involved people killed by police under such circumstances.</p>
<p>In November of 2013, Ian Pryce was killed by Toronto police while apparently holding what turned out to be a pellet gun. Only months later, John Caleb Ross of Aurora was killed by a York Regional police officer while apparently carrying a pellet gun. On March 13, 2016, Alex Wettlaufer was shot three times and killed by Toronto police. He was said to have held a pellet gun but by the SIU’s own account had repeatedly set down during a lengthy standoff.</p>

He reports that Lucien Silverquill was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the leg. He says his brother was alive for some time but in great pain.</p>

In his view more than half an hour passed before Lucien Silverquill was put into the ambulance that had arrived on the scene (Pasiuk 2019). In his words: “It was a very horrific scene when we got there&#8230;.They didn’t give him CPR or anything like that. They just pinned him to the ground. That’s what we saw” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill also points out the lack of information and response to questions by RCMP. He says that RCMP refused to let family members near his injured brother. According to Moses Silverquill: “It was very hard to get answers from [RCMP] as to what was going on with my brother” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>He has many questions about police actions before, during, and after the shooting. He wonders why alternative approaches were not taken and why police acted so quickly to shoot and were so single minded in privileging arrest over medical care, which his brother clearly needed. He asks: “I know the police officer that did the shooting must be really emotionally disturbed but was it dealt with properly? That’s the question&#8230;. Could this guy’s life have been saved?” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill reflects on the brother taken from his family by police violence: “My brother was a good person&#8230;. He had kids. He left little kids. I know he was a caring guy when he was with his family” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>

In his view more than half an hour passed before Lucien Silverquill was put into the ambulance that had arrived on the scene (Pasiuk 2019). In his words: “It was a very horrific scene when we got there&#8230;.They didn’t give him CPR or anything like that. They just pinned him to the ground. That’s what we saw” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill also points out the lack of information and response to questions by RCMP. He says that RCMP refused to let family members near his injured brother. According to Moses Silverquill: “It was very hard to get answers from [RCMP] as to what was going on with my brother” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>He has many questions about police actions before, during, and after the shooting. He wonders why alternative approaches were not taken and why police acted so quickly to shoot and were so single minded in privileging arrest over medical care, which his brother clearly needed. He asks: “I know the police officer that did the shooting must be really emotionally disturbed but was it dealt with properly? That’s the question&#8230;. Could this guy’s life have been saved?” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill reflects on the brother taken from his family by police violence: “My brother was a good person&#8230;. He had kids. He left little kids. I know he was a caring guy when he was with his family” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>

This time, as officers entered Din's room, they Tasered him and then shot him three times, twice in the head, according to Din's family. Maple Ridge News reported that a neighbour recalled hearing two loud bangs and police say one officer fired a weapon. Din had a knife when officers confronted him, according to police. His family, on the other hand, says he only had a glass bottle. An investigation is ongoing.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>British Columbia RCMP shot and killed a man who has been identified by family members as Kyaw Din (54) at a Maple Ridge home on August 11, 2019. The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

Savage then asked to go back inside to retrieve some of his belongings. An officer escorted him. Once inside, Savage grabbed a knife and injured himself. The BEI says he made a threatening gesture toward the officer, who then shot him. He was transported to hospital and pronounced dead. An investigation is ongoing. ;    Persons who died IN police custody       ***<p>Quebec’s provincial police force (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) shot and killed a 53-year-old man in Lavaltrie, Quebec (Lanaudière region), on June 22, 2020. The Bureau des enquetes independantes (Bureau of Independent Investigations, BEI), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the killing.</p>
<p>The BEI report that provincial police were called to a home in Lavaltrie around 8:20 PM in response to an alleged domestic dispute between a man and a woman. Police removed the man from the home but escorted him back inside to retrieve his wallet and some belongings. According to the BEI, police claim that once inside the man took a knife and injured himself. In response, as is far too typical, an SQ officer shot him and killed him.</p>
<p>Once again, when faced with someone apparently in distress and believed to pose a harm to themselves, police take action to do worse harm to the person. They act hastily to kill them.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks alone, the BEI has opened six investigations into police violence, including the RCMP killing of Rodney Levi, a Metepenagiag First Nation man, in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The BEI is not an independent investigative agency. They rely on other police forces to do their investigations. The Montreal police service will be taking part in the investigation of this killing. The very force that killed a 51-year-old man two days before.</p>
       ***<p>A 51-year-old man died after being pepper sprayed and subdued by Montreal police late Saturday night.

<p>Police allegedly caught up to him near the corner of Ontario and Saint-Timothée streets, where they pepper sprayed, subdued, and handcuffed him. During the takedown and arrest, the man lost consciousness and did not have a pulse. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead there.</p>

Choudry’s family says that he had schizophrenia and they called a non-emergency helpline. Paramedics who arrived on the scene called the police when they saw Choudry with a pocket knife. Bystander video shows three officers on his balcony yelling at him to put his knife down. They eventually fired five shots into his apartment. Police entered the apartment and reportedly fired more shots. The officers used several use-of-force methods, including a Taser and plastic projectiles. Choudry was ultimately shot. The family told CBC that Choudry didn't speak English, information they say they had shared with the police. An investigation is ongoing.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       <p>Peel Region police shot and killed 62-year-old Ejaz Ahmed Choudry on Saturday, June 20, 2020. He was reportedly shot five times in the back. Mr. Choudry, a Muslim man, was experiencing mental health crisis and needed support and care, not police primed to shoot to kill. He was a husband and father of four, the youngest of whom is only seven.</p>
<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, reports that police were called to an apartment unit at 3425 Morning Star Drive, near Goreway Drive, at around 5 PM, to “check on the well-being of a man.” Family members have since said that Mr. Choudry suffered from schizophrenia as well as other illnesses. He was alone in the unit and did not pose a threat to the public or others. Family members have described him as harmless.</p>
<p>For an older man in crisis alone in his room, posing no threat to others, police sent multiple officers and a canine unit. A video taken by a witness and posted on twitter, shows police tactical units putting climbing a ladder and breaking into Mr. Choudry’s second floor apartment from the balcony. Three officers are shown kicking open the door and shouting into the residence. One can imagine the awful impact this might have on someone said to be in crisis. Several gunshots can be heard before all three officers even enter the apartment, again raising issues of the shoot first approach by police officers. This is one reason that they should not be sent out on mental health related calls.</p>
<p>Incredibly, police have sought to explain killing Mr. Choudry by suggesting they were concerned about his safety. Peel Constable Sarah Patten claims: “The state of crisis that he was in and the belief that he had access to weapons, yes, we believe that he was a danger to himself” (quoted in CBC News 2020). Patten makes the absurd statement that officers broke into his apartment “to check on his well-being” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>According to the SIU, police claim that once police entered the apartment unit, “an interaction occurred which included officers deploying a conducted energy weapon at the man, as well as firing plastic projectiles from an Anti-Riot Weapon Enfield” (quoted in CBC News 2020). Again, we must ask why police were doing a supposed wellness check with anti-riot weapons?</p>
<p>The mentality of police is reflected in this statement by Peel Regional Police Constable Akhil Mooken, who said, tellingly: “Communication was initiated with the man to try to communicate a peaceful surrender” (quoted in Yuen 2020). Surrender. This is the language of war. For someone needing health care supports.<br />
Family Members Not Allowed to Help</p>
<p>Family members who were present say that Mr. Choudry had come to the door when other families had been removed from the unit but was frightened back in when he saw officers coming toward him. An entirely understandable response to seeing police coming at you.</p>
<p>Khizar Shahzad, a nephew, reports that he informed the supervising officer of the severity of his uncle’s condition and told the officer the man was frightened: “I said, ‘Hey, he’s scared of your uniform, he’s not scared of you’” (quoted in CBC News 2020). The family pleaded with police to allow them to speak with their loved one who did not speak English. Police refusal to allow this is common in cases where police have been called about someone in mental health distress. Family who know the person and how best to interact with them are removed and kept from participating. This often plays a part in deadly police actions.</p>
<p>Muhammed Choudry, also a nephew, implored police: “Let me go upstairs, let my dad go upstairs, let my brother go upstairs. Because we’ve done this before where he listens. He listens to us” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>Family members say Mr. Choudry had difficulty breathing and walking. Mr. Choudry died at the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demands for Review and Inquiry</p>
<p>The Muslim Council of Peel has called for an immediate review of police use of force, particularly during mental-health calls. They also want publicly available race-based demographic data on police shootings. As they note in a media release:</p>
<p>“A disproportionate number of racialized individuals including Black, Indigenous and Muslim are the victims of police shootings across Canada and right here in Peel Region” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>The council and family are demanding an independent public inquiry into the police killing of Ejaz Choudry. In their words:</p>
<p>“Given the video evidence and the testimony of family members, Peel police’s conduct in this matter was clearly excessive and requires nothing short of an independent inquiry unconnected to the SIU” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>Police are heard in the video shouting at Mr. Choudry to put a gun down. No gun was retrieved at the scene.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned six investigators and three forensic investigators to examine the police killing of Ejaz Choudry.</p>

A former boyfriend asked police to check on Moore after he received strange messages from her on Facebook. Police say that the officer arrived on the scene and was suddenly confronted by Moore, who was allegedly wielding a knife. Moore's family contests the police account of events. The officer then shot Moore multiple times, according to a family member. The incident was ""really quick,"" according to police. Moore died at the scene. An investigation is ongoing.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       <p>Edmundston Police (New Brunswick) shot and killed Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman of Tlaoquiaht First Nation, near Tofino, so-called British Columbia, during a so-called wellness check early in the morning of June 4, 2020. The family has reported that the victim was shot five times by police. Edmundston Police Force Inspector Steve Robinson told reporters that he did not believe that the officer in question attempted to use any non-lethal force. Chantel Moore was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Chantel Moore’s grandmother, Nora Martin, is certain the killing is racist in nature. In her words: “When I first heard about it, that was my first thought: ‘This was racially motivated.’ We’ve been dealing with police brutality for a number of years. I know in my own family it’s been going on for a long time” (quoted in CTV News 2020).</p>
<p>The history of policing in Canada is one of racism and white supremacy at its core. Policing has played a central part in the dispossession, displacement, subjugation, control, killing, and genocide of Indigenous people and communities—has been central to the interlinking settler colonial capitalist projects. And policing continues to play a key part in maintaining those projects up to the present.</p>
<p>This is yet another, too common, case of police being the first sent out when people are believed to be in crisis or in need of a “wellness check.” Police should not be sent under these circumstances. They are not health care providers. Too often the outcome is police killing the person needing support or care. Police are not about wellness. Resources for health care, including mental health care, should be diverted away from police and used in community health care supports. Police budgets continue to grow as necessary health care services require more funding.</p>
<p>Police will be investigating police in this killing. Officers from Saint John will be part of the investigation as well as an as yet unnamed “independent agency” (which will in no way be independent given the involvement of police in the investigation).</p>

       *<p>Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert, who killed Bony Jean-Pierre (46) in April 2016, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge against him. Gilbert shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a plastic bullet during a raid. The killing of Jean-Pierre sparked an uprising in the Montreal North Neighborhood where the shooting happened. The charge against officer Gilbert represents only the ninth time since 1999 that an officer has been charged in the injuring or killing of a civilian in Quebec.</p>
<p>Gilbert was not present in court for the July 6, 2017 appearance.  His defence lawyer Isabelle Briand also informed the court that Gilbert wants a trial by judge and jury. Gilbert’s next court date is scheduled for August 29, 2017.</p>
       *<p>It is among the rarest of occurrences in Canada that a killer cop is ever charged for taking the life of a civilian. Oversight agencies, which are not autonomous or independent of police, prosecutors, and judges work to ensure that the state protects the state and killer cops are legitimized. On Wednesday, May 24, 2017 one of those rare events occurred with the laying of charges against Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert who killed 46-year-old Bony Jean-Pierre on March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Murder charges against police are unheard of and officer Gilbert has been charged with manslaughter. He shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a rubber bullet, a projectile that police routinely use, as in protests for example, and which police propagandists pose as non-lethal.  The charges were announced by Quebec’s Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP). Officer Gilbert was released under a promise to appear on July 6, 2017.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), Quebec’s investigation unit, which now examines incidents of police harm to civilians was not established when the investigation into Jean-Pierre’s killing was initiated. Instead the charges come, incredibly, following an investigation by Quebec provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ).</p>
<p>The Montreal North community, long angered by police targeting and violence organized and mobilized in response to the police killing of Jean-Pierre. At least 100 people participated in a march and rally in June. At that time some cars and banks were vandalized and objects thrown at the police station in a community uprising. The march occurred on what would have been the 26th birthday of Fredy Villanueva, a young man shot and killed by police in 2008 when Montreal policed moved aggressively to break up a game of dice in a park. Yes, he was killed for playing dice. The killing of Fredy Villanueva highlighted the racist targeted policing practices of Montreal police, reinforced by the killing of Bony Jean-Pierre.</p>

My cousin isn’t the type of person to be an aggressor.” (quoted in Laing 2019).</p>
<p>Another cousin, Angela Fiddler, has reflected on Robin Fiddler’s determination and humor. In her words:</p>
<p>“She always tried to get through whatever systemic barriers that she faced — she always tried to make a way. She was just a blessing to us. It was her smile, she was always so funny and she always wanted to make people laugh.<br />
“When we were both younger, I just took her under my wing and that was that. She would come live with me when she had the opportunity. I’ve always had an open door for her. Robin was a beautiful soul, she deserved to live.”</p>
<p>Calgary police Chief Mark Neufeld has said that the officer who killed Fiddler was wearing a police-issued, body-worn camera at the time of the killing. No video has been released publicly. Robin Fiddler’s killing is at least the third police-involved death in Calgary in 2019.</p>

Police were reportedly called to the area of University and Ouellette avenues at about 8:05 AM regarding a complaint involving a man. Finding a man who allegedly matched the description they had police confronted the man. During that confrontation police fired multiple rounds from a service pistol or pistols. It has note been reported publicly how many officers fired weapons. The man was struck by a shot or shots and taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at 9:29 AM.</p>
<p>One witness, John Hilt, relates that he was crossing Ouellette Avenue when he heard five gunshots. In his words, there was a pause between volleys fired: “I heard three shots plain as day, a break for about two seconds, then two more” (quoted in Taekema 2018). This could become an issue in the investigation if police fired after a pause when the man was already down and incapacitated.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines police harm to civilians is investigating. They have assigned six investigators and four forensic investigators to the killing. In a statement it claims that there was an interaction between the man and officers, and the man was shot at by police and struck. A post-mortem exam is scheduled for Thursday in London, Ontario.</p>

       <p>Family members have identified Matthew Mahoney as the 33-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Windsor police on March 21, 2018. They say that he struggled with schizophrenia and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>In a interview with CBC News, older brother Michael Mahoney says a lack of resources in healthcare and limits to the legal system failed his brother. He also noted the inappropriateness and unsuitability of police dealing with mental health issues. In his words:</p>
<p>“Our police aren&#8217;t trained to deal with people who are suffering the way my brother is. That can make it really hard when they encounter someone like him. You’re not sure  if this person is dangerous or just needs a hug. I think my brother needed a hug that morning. I wish I could have been there.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, confirmed on March 23 that Matthew Mahoney was shot by two officers who discharged firearms and “struck multiple times.” The SIU has identified eight witness officers in addition to the two subject officers, suggesting that at least ten officers confronted the victim on the street.</p>
<p>This leaves the family with many questions. Said Michael Mahoney:</p>
<p>“We definitely want to know what my brother was going through that morning. We want to know how the police became involved and we want to know that they did everything they could to deescalate the situation. Right now we’re just trying to focus on remembering Matthew the way we remember him and we&#8217;re trying not to think about that morning because your mind just races and there’s no answers right now.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He reports that his brother’s mental health struggles, developing as a teenager, worsened as he became an adult. While medications offered some help, he was extremely fearful of authorities, a not unreasonable feeling. Michael Mahoney relates:</p>
<p>“Being in the health care system can be extremely terrifying, extremely dangerous and he did everything in his life to try to avoid going back to hospital. Every decision he made was to try to avoid interactions with police or mental health services. They were his biggest fears.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>Matthew Mahoney needed care and a hug not cops and bullets. Michael Mahoney is left to conclude: “The system just isn’t set up right to help people with extreme needs like my brother&#8230;This didn’t need to happen” (quoted in Taekema 2018). Even worse, in the end the system actively killed Matthew Mahoney.</p>

Joey Knapaysweet was from the James Bay community of Fort Albany — more than an hour’s flight from Timmins. According to the family statement, he had gone to Timmins to “seek help in dreams for betterment of his life.” On Thursday, February 15, the family released a statement from Fort Albany saying they need answers about why police chose to kill their loved one.</p>

<p>The police killing of Joey Knapaysweet occurred the same weekend as another Cree person from Fort Albany, 62-year-old Agnes Sutherland, died in custody of Timmins police. Their deaths through police interactions, happened as an all-white jury in Saskatchewan was about to acquit white farmer Gerald Stanley in the 2016 killing of a young Cree man, Colten Boushie. The Stanley trial and acquittal brought international attention to white supremacy, colonialism, and racism in Canada and Canadian criminal justice. The Stanley verdict sparked protests across the country against the mistreatment of Indigenous people throughout the justice system in Canada.</p>

In Timmins a vigil before the Stanley trial verdict brought out at least 100 people.

It ruled the death homicide, which in a coroner's inquest means a death as aesult of the purposeful actions of another person and does not carry any criminal connotations.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>Six years after Brian Gray, 39, was killed by members of the Ontario Provincial Police Emergency Response Team at Whitefish Bay on the Lac Seul First Nation in Northern Ontario, the jury in the coroner’s inquest into his killing has released its recommendations. These show both the delay in responding to police killings in Canada as well as the limited framework for addressing police violence and lethal force.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest noted that officers took more than four hours to each the residence at Whitefish Bay after the initial call was made reporting an incident at the home, May 9, 2010. This became notable for the jury because by the time the Emergency Response Team arrived the situation had escalated well beyond the incident that gave rise to the call to police. Indeed Gray had taken time to leave the site of the initial incident on at least one occasion returning to his own home before returning.</p>
<p>According to the initial report of the provincial police oversight body, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) Gray had actually released a hostage right before police responded by shooting him several times killing him. He apparently gave out a large scream right before he was shot but one would hope this did not startle officers causing a panicked response. Gray was still conscious after being shot and police handcuffed him before taking him to an ambulance. He died at the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre. In any event the SIU, not surprisingly, determined that the police execution of Gray was justified. They cleared three OPP officers involved in killing Gray.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest jury found that Brian Gray was killed died as a result of multiple &#8220;gunshot wounds to the torso&#8221; (Porter 2016). The jury ruled Gray’s death to be a homicide. In this context the ruling means that the death is “a result of the purposeful actions of another person and does not carry any criminal connotations” (Porter 2016).</p>
<p>The jury made 18 recommendations with regard to the inquiry in Gray’s killing and these did recognize the problems within the O.P.P in terms of aboriginal awareness and interactions with indigenous civilians. As is disproportionately the case in incidents of lethal police violence against civilians the person killed is experiencing a mental health issue that finds a response not in care but in policing. Among the 18 recommendations issued by the jury are these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Options for more effective tactical response should be explored, including but not limited to enhanced Emergency Response Team (ERT) training, upgrading the North Western Region ERT team to level 2 Tactical capabilities, and placing a Tactics and Rescue unit (TRU) team in Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>The OPP should ensure that all members working with aboriginal communities and people receive Aboriginal Awareness Training that should be updated when necessary.</p>
<p>When OPP Officers are deployed in a location where they might be expected to attend on a First Nation, they should attend and be familiarized with that First Nation soon after being deployed to that Detachment.</p>
<p>When a critical incident occurs, an individual or individuals should be identified by Lac Seul First Nation to liaise between the police, First Nation and family of the subject, for the purpose of improving communication, and keeping the families informed of the progress of an incident.</p>
<p>Lac Seul First Nation should receive funding to hire a certified mental health counsellor, to hire and train additional mental health workers, to train its existing mental health workers, and to increase awareness of mental health issues and to initiate early intervention within the community.” (Porter 2016)</p>

<p>None of the recommendations from a coroner&#8217;s inquest are binding.</p>

The woman, Morris's fiancée, said that he had plans for suicide. As the encounter progressed, police dispatched a negotiator to the scene. The negotiator tried to convince Morris to trade his knives for a cigarette lighter, which made him more agitated, his fiancée said. Morris's fiancée, who was seated between his legs, heard a gunshot and felt a splatter of blood. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       <p>The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) is calling for an independent investigation after the killing of Geoff Morris (41) by Regina Police Service officers on May 4, 2019. In a news release, FSIN Vice Chief Dutch Lerat noted that,</p>
<p>“We have seen officers investigating their fellow officers and we all know how those investigations turn out. We are calling on the Regina Police Service to allow for an outside and independent oversight body to be a part of this investigation. We have been calling for this for years and these senseless police-related deaths keep happening.”</p>
<p>Morris was shot and killed by Regina police, during what cops say was a hostage situation. There are reasons to be skeptical about this given the lack of public information around another recent alleged hostage-taking in which two people were killed by RCMP in Surrey, British Columbia in March 2019. In that case it was later revealed that police had shot and killed both people, including the alleged hostage Nona McEwan. Notably, Regina Police chief Evan Bray would not say whether an alleged hostage was still being held when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Indeed, the police justification of events is being contradicted by Morris’ fiancé, Jasmine Brass, who says she was present when Morris was killed. In her words: “Honestly it wasn’t necessary for them to kill him, they could’ve just tased him” (quoted in Melnychuck 2019). She reports that Morris had been struggling with mental health issues and that she and her sister were with Morris trying to help him the morning he was killed by police.</p>
<p>Brass also reports that he became more agitated when police arrived, a not uncommon occurrence as the appearance of police typically heightens tensions and stress. She gives a chilling account, saying on facebook that she heard a “bang” and felt a splatter of blood at the moment of killing. Incredibly Brass reports that police shot Morris while she sat between his legs.</p>
<p>Morris was biological father to four children. He also took in six other children and raised them. One daughter, Tanisha Whiteman, remembers him as a good, loving man who struggled with anxiety issues. She asks why police acted so quickly to kill. In her words:</p>
<p>“That’s somebody’s father. That’s somebody’s son. That’s somebody’s brother, somebody’s nephew. He was loved by so many people. Why? Just like that, he’s gone. There could have been other ways that could have been handled. They didn’t have to take someone’s life away (quoted in Whitfield 2019a).</p>
<p>Heartbreaking words about the role played by police came from 12-year-old son Nakayoh Friday: “I want people to know that the people who were supposed to protect us aren’t protecting us. They are killing us. I don’t want other families to go through my pain” (quoted in Whitfield 2019b).</p>
<p>According to Regina Police chief Evan Bray, legislation requires that the Regina Police Service’s Major Crime unit investigates the shooting. Cops investigating cops. The officer involved in the shooting was a member of the patrol response remains on active duty.</p>
<p>Regina police claim that the killing of Morris is the first killing by an officer in the city since 1998. Police also claim that there have been four officer-involved shootings in the last 10 years, with none of those resulting in the death of the victim.</p>

An unidentified witness who fled the home said she saw two officers running toward it; one was holding a rifle. Officers heard bullets strike the police truck of a third officer as they drove from the front to the back of Richard's residence. The officers say that Richard exited his home, rifle in hand, and aimed at one of them. A total of 17 shots were fired from rifles held by two officers.

The victim’s identity was confirmed publicly by his sister Patricia Richard. She reports that she called police after speaking with her mother because she believed her brother to be ‘freaking out’ and shooting out of the house where her mother lives.</p>
<p>Patricia Richard had hoped police would protect her brother, not shoot him. She is upset at how police handled the situation, believing it could have and should have ended differently.</p>
<p>She has since said that her mother told her: “They went rushing in there. Everything happened too quick. She said they didn’t have to [shoot him]. He wasn’t threatening anyone, he just snapped on himself” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The victim’s niece, Tammy Smith, said she was outside the house in a pickup truck with Richard’s mother when three officers spotted Richard through a window and started shooting at him. She describes a chaotic, reckless, rush to lethal force. In her words: “I was backing up to see if I could see Ben, when all the shots came from the (police). I’m pretty sure they all unloaded their clips. We just started screaming” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>She echoed the family’s feelings of anger over how the situation was handled: “It should not have escalated to that point. They should have waited for more people. They should have tried to wait it out. They were all outside, shooting through the walls and windows. They never even entered the house&#8230;” (quoted in Rollason 2019)</p>
<p>Witnesses suggest that the victim was only firing his weapon into an empty field and the ceiling of the house. They say he posed no threat to anyone, but was simply upset. She relates: &#8220;His mother, last week, called the [police] to take him to the hospital so he could be assessed. But when they came and talked to him, they said he wasn’t a threat to anyone. Then a week later, they come back and shoot him” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>Patricia Richard has said that in her view the officers were “trigger-happy.” She suggests: “They knew my brother needed help a few days before anything happened. He was unstable. Everyone saw the signs” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>And she concludes: “I believe what happened could have been 100 per cent preventable” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>Smith remembers Benjamin Richard in these terms: “He was kind, caring and always thinking of others more than himself. The world lost a great man. My heart breaks” (quoted in Macdonnell 2019).</p>
<p>According to the Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba, it was notified by Manitoba First Nations Police that officers had responded to a report of a man armed with a firearm in a residence at around 6 PM. During an encounter at least one office fired a weapon, striking the man. The victim, Benjamin Richard was pronounced dead on the scene. Three officers involved in the case are now on administrative leave.</p>

       *<p>Once again killer cops get off. The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, has announced that it will not be recommending charges against the RCMP officers who shot and killed Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson on March 29, 2019 in a home on the 13300 block of 98A Street in Surrey. The decision was made public on April 1, 2020. Four officers were directly involved in the killings. None have been named publicly. The IIO reports that the officers fired over forty rounds, in close quarters. Forty.</p>
<p>Police described the context of the killings as a “hostage taking.” For over a month after the killings, RCMP publicly implied that Randy Crosson had killed Nona McEwan.</p>
<p>When asked directly in 2019 if he could say conclusively that a police bullet did not hit Nona McEwan, the Surrey Now-Leader reported that Integrated Homicide Investigation Team spokesperson Corporal Frank Jang replied:</p>
<p>“No, I mean that’s all part of the investigation that’s happening now. There will be updates coming forth from the IIO but all those details, the exact mechanism, entries, where the shots came from, that’s all going to be part of the investigation. I can’t comment further because it’s still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Not long afterward the lie was put to the police portrayal when the IIO reported that RCMP had shot and killed both McEwan and Crosson. Clearly, officers at the scene, and IHIT member Jang must have known that police had done the shooting. One might also figure that they knew this as they made statements over a month that posed Crosson as potentially the killer.</p>
<p>The IIO concluded that Crosson “provoked an armed response from police aimed at saving her.” A rather incredible statement given that firing at McEwan, striking, and killing her can in no way credibly be described as a response aimed at “saving her.”</p>
<p>The IIO, which is not a truly independent body and has had former officers among its members as well as relying on police for training, interviewed 38 witness police officers to determine that none of the four officers directly involved committed any criminal offense. Any criminal offense. Not at all surprising given that killer cops are virtually never held anywhere near accountable when they kill in Canada.</p>
       *<p>Many questions have been unanswered since two people, later identified as Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson, were killed during an alleged hostage taking and police standoff in Surrey, British Columbia on March 29, 2019. Foremost among these was whether RCMP officers actually fired the fatal shots, killing both people. Police have been notably silent on that question all the while putting out a public narrative that they used lethal force to save a hostage who was probably killed by the hostage taker. On May 2 the horrible answer finally came. The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO) has publicly confirmed that both Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson were killed by multiple shots fired by the RCMP.</p>
<p>Initial reports suggested that both had been shot with Crosson dying at the scene and McEwan dying later in hospital. Police alleged that Crosson had taken McEwan hostage and implied that police violence was necessary to save the hostage.</p>
<p>When asked previously by reporters if he could say conclusively that a police bullet did not hit Nona McEwan, the <a href=""https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/focus-on-surreys-iio-keeping-the-cops-accountable/""><em>Surrey Now-Leader</em></a> reports that Integrated Homicide Investigation Team spokesperson Corporal Frank Jang replied:</p>

I can’t comment further because it’s still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Police control the information flow when they kill in the Canadian context. In various cases when they kill, they frame reports of events to blame victims or suggest that police acted heroically under immediate threat. As in this case they suggest that a victim was killed by “a suspect” rather than by police.</p>

<p>Police described the context of the killings as a “hostage taking.” For over a month after the killings, RCMP publicly implied that Randy Crosson had killed Nona McEwan.</p>
<p>When asked directly in 2019 if he could say conclusively that a police bullet did not hit Nona McEwan, the Surrey Now-Leader reported that Integrated Homicide Investigation Team spokesperson Corporal Frank Jang replied:</p>
<p>“No, I mean that’s all part of the investigation that’s happening now. There will be updates coming forth from the IIO but all those details, the exact mechanism, entries, where the shots came from, that’s all going to be part of the investigation. I can’t comment further because it’s still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Not long afterward the lie was put to the police portrayal when the IIO reported that RCMP had shot and killed both McEwan and Crosson. Clearly, officers at the scene, and IHIT member Jang must have known that police had done the shooting. One might also figure that they knew this as they made statements over a month that posed Crosson as potentially the killer.</p>
<p>The IIO concluded that Crosson “provoked an armed response from police aimed at saving her.” A rather incredible statement given that firing at McEwan, striking, and killing her can in no way credibly be described as a response aimed at “saving her.”</p>
<p>The IIO, which is not a truly independent body and has had former officers among its members as well as relying on police for training, interviewed 38 witness police officers to determine that none of the four officers directly involved committed any criminal offense. Any criminal offense. Not at all surprising given that killer cops are virtually never held anywhere near accountable when they kill in Canada.</p>
       *<p>Many questions have been unanswered since two people, later identified as Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson, were killed during an alleged hostage taking and police standoff in Surrey, British Columbia on March 29, 2019. Foremost among these was whether RCMP officers actually fired the fatal shots, killing both people. Police have been notably silent on that question all the while putting out a public narrative that they used lethal force to save a hostage who was probably killed by the hostage taker. On May 2 the horrible answer finally came. The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO) has publicly confirmed that both Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson were killed by multiple shots fired by the RCMP.</p>
<p>Initial reports suggested that both had been shot with Crosson dying at the scene and McEwan dying later in hospital. Police alleged that Crosson had taken McEwan hostage and implied that police violence was necessary to save the hostage.</p>
<p>When asked previously by reporters if he could say conclusively that a police bullet did not hit Nona McEwan, the <a href=""https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/focus-on-surreys-iio-keeping-the-cops-accountable/""><em>Surrey Now-Leader</em></a> reports that Integrated Homicide Investigation Team spokesperson Corporal Frank Jang replied:</p>
<p>“No, I mean that’s all part of the investigation that’s happening now. There will be updates coming forth from the IIO but all those details, the exact mechanism, entries, where the shots came from, that’s all going to be part of the investigation. I can’t comment further because it’s still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Police control the information flow when they kill in the Canadian context. In various cases when they kill, they frame reports of events to blame victims or suggest that police acted heroically under immediate threat. As in this case they suggest that a victim was killed by “a suspect” rather than by police.</p>

His cousin, who lived near Madut in Winnipeg, said he had mental health issues. A neighbour found Madut banging on the door of a unit with a hammer. According to an IIU report, police arrived and saw Madut enter a suite that was not his own; there was evident damage on the doorway. They attempted to detain him. Madut ran back to his own suite, where he and police continued a physical struggle. Madut then approached the officers with a hammer. One officer shot him three times, killing him.;    Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer       <p>Winnipeg police shot and killed Machuar Mawien Madut, a 43-year-old South Sudanese migrant whom community members have said was struggling with mental health issues due to separation from his family. The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba identified Madut as the victim shot by police on Saturday, February 23, 2019.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba (IIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, reports that police were called to 82 Colony Street at 9:43 AM regarding a man armed with a hammer potentially breaking into a suite. Madut was shot by police and taken to Health Sciences Centre where he later died.</p>
<p>Sandy Deng, a member of the community, rejects the police explanation of the killing. In her words:</p>
<p>“It breaks my heart. This is a typical stereotype for a lot of people who come from marginalized communities, because there&#8217;s always a justification for a shooting. He was a human being. He was supposed to be supported. He was one day away from seeing his mental health specialist, and instead of mobile crisis being called, the police were called.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>Madut and his family fled war in Sudan, coming to Canada in 2003. He had four children who moved to British Columbia with his wife after the couple separated a couple of years ago and Madut had struggled with mental health since then.</p>
<p>Deng described him as a very kind man:</p>
<p>“He came to the community here all the time to hang out, he never really bothered anybody. Apart from that, he had been living with a lot of challenges, including mental health, language barriers, adjustment to this new community.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba had been working with health services, including the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and Manitoba’s Employment and Income Assistance Program, to help Madut with his mental health issues.</p>
<p>On Saturday, before he was shot by police, Madut had been moving furniture out of his apartment for as yet unknown reasons. A cousin, Ayei Madut, said the man had been dealing with a broken door in his apartment.</p>
<p>Ayei Madut also questions why police responded , and so immediately, with lethal force. In his words:</p>
<p>“I’m really not trusting the police, because we assume they have all the resource how to deal with people with mental issues, with different background. For me I can’t even trust them because this situation, I could do it better than whatever they did.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>Alexa Potashnik, president of Black Space Winnipeg, also directed skepticism toward Winnipeg police. As she notes: “This just unfortunately is a reminder that police brutality and violence happens in all areas across our country and we need answers” (quoted in CBC News 2019).</p>
<p>She adds that violence against Black people by police must be addressed in Winnipeg. In her view:</p>
<p>“There’s no justice or accountability from the Winnipeg police department and this is unacceptable and it’s an inexcusable act of violence toward the South Sudanese community, toward the black community. We’re not going to take this lying down and we’re going to show up and demand justice for our community.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The killing by police of a Black man and man experiencing mental health distress highlights ongoing issues of police violence and use of lethal force in Canada.</p>
<p>The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba will hold a rally outside police headquarters on March 1 to demand answers “and shed light into the gaps that we have in mental health services and how police officers might not be well-equipped to deal with people with mental health issues and language barriers” (quoted in CBC News 2019).</p>
<p>Machuar Mawien Madut is the third person shot by Winnipeg police already in 2019.</p>

Ritchie's brother, who lived in a nearby apartment, said he heard a scream followed by more than two gunshots.

According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, police were called to the area of the Elmvale Mall on St. Laurent Blvd at around 7:53 AM. The reason for the call was allegedly a report of “a suspicious person.” At the time of this initial report, no details have been released publicly on what made the person suspicious. At around 8:00 AM shots were fired, and the victim was killed. The SIU has confirmed that a police officer shot the victim.</p>
       <p>Greg Ritchie, a 30-year-old Ojibwe man from Saugeen First Nation near Owen Sound, Ontario, has been identified as the man shot and killed by Ottawa police on January 31. Family members have spoken publicly to say he was experiencing mental health crises and was heading to a pharmacy to pick up medication when he was shot and killed by police. The responding officers have been identified as Ottawa constables Thanh Tran and Daniel Vincelette. Witnesses have reported hearing more than two shots. Tran is a repeat offender. He and another officer had been charged, in September 2011, with assault causing bodily harm following the arrest of an intoxicated 50-year-old homeless man.</p>
<p>Family members say Ritchie, who had been taken from his mother and placed in foster care, had struggled with mental health issues from a young age. He had moved to Ottawa to live with his brother and his partner. Ritchie’s sister-in-law reports that he was in good spirits the morning he was killed, having received his Ontario Disability Support Program payment and going out for a coffee. He then set out to get his medication, suffering a headache and recovering from a concussion. He had been a customer at the pharmacy at Elmvale Acres Mall since arriving in Ottawa.</p>

<p>In the words of his sister-in-law, Chantel Ritchie:</p>
<p>“And the thing is, that’s not the kind of guy he is. He gets scared…and that’s the saddest part. We know that he was in complete and utter terror in a moment like that. He’s scared of just going into a grocery store…of just being in a crowd, because he’s afraid that people want to do something to him or don’t like him because of the way he looks.</p>
<p>“And honestly, we’ve seen it. People just take one look and that’s it. He’s First Nations, he’s been homeless before, and he is afraid.

And it just really hurts that we weren&#8217;t there to be able to calm him down because there’s no way that any of this would have happened if we were there. There&#8217;s no way.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>Chantal Ritchie says Greg Ritchie felt better around family and was very involved in learning about his culture. She worries that cultural materials he carried with him might have been misinterpreted as weapons by the police who killed him. In her words:</p>
<p>“I could tell right away he suffered from mental illness, but when he was around family he was very happy. He was very into his culture and learning about his ancestors. He did sometimes exhibit that he feels the pain of what happened to his people…but he was just happy to be around family and to be at powwows and helping at those events.</p>
<p>“He was sometimes hired to keep sacred fires going at ceremonies, and spent time in woods and rivers looking for arrowheads. It also comforted him to recreate arrowheads and other artifacts.</p>

Alcohol and cocaine in his system.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>Police agencies and their ideological supporters, often located in criminology and psychology departments in universities and colleges, have developed entire cottage industries producing pseudo-science and pseudo-forensics, phony analyses, concepts, and terms, to justify and excuse police killings of civilians. These pseudo-scientific projects have constructed their own literatures, bodies of ideas, and “expert” witnesses supporting dubious “diagnoses” used to “explain” how it is that victims of police violence came to be responsible (biologically or psychologically) for their own murders.</p>
<p>Among the most pernicious and extensively developed and deployed of these pseudo-scientific diagnoses are the notorious notions of excited delirium and so-called suicide by cop. Neither of these has any scientific basis or legitimate supporting evidence to back them. They offer little, in fact, beyond the statements of police “researchers” (cops and former cops who have used such work not only to support their colleagues and former colleagues but to claim positions in academia) and some compliant criminologists and psychologists and others supportive of police on ideological or opportunistic grounds (i.e. funding).</p>
<p>While the dubious claim of excited delirium has no psychological or medical basis it is routinely used to let police officers walk away from any accountability when they kill civilians. Despite the recognition that excited delirium has no basis in scientific, psychological or medical, reality, it is still used in investigative cases on police killings, often by coroners’ offices in the Canadian context, for example.</p>
<p>In Canada the excited delirium excuse was used to let killer cops off the hook in two cases within a three week period over October and November of 2016. These cases involved the police killing of Maurizio Facchin (50) in Burnaby, British Columbia, in 2014 and Simon Chung (34) in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2013. Both cases involved the use of tasers by police and the men went into fatal distress only after a taser was used on them. Chung was also subjected to attempts by two Edmonton police to restrain him forcefully. He was tased twice by an officer while restrained, including one blast that lasted 28 seconds (Parsons 2016). In both cases the role of the taser in the men’s deaths was acknowledged yet both deaths were ruled accidental.</p>
<p>Notably in the case of the police killing of Simon Chung one of the officers claimed to suspect that the victim was experiencing excited delirium yet chose to restrain and taser him anyway. This would suggest culpability in his death given the claims of police that excited delirium could lead to a fatal response to either restraint or tasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dubious Diagnosis of Excited Delirium</p>
<p>Excited delirium has come under growing public scrutiny in recent years given the overwhelming proportion of diagnoses related to deaths involving police use of compliance holds and/or use of tasers. Typically these diagnoses are provided only by medical examiners not by hospital or emergency room doctors. Furthermore, and as alarming, there is the fact that excited delirium is presently not a recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis by either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IVTR) of the American Psychiatric Association or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) of the World Health Organization. Due to these troubling facts, it is widely considered that the real cause of death in cases identified after the fact as instances of excited delirium are actually caused by straightforward police violence and use if force. These are related to taser use and positional asphyxia.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups have argued that diagnoses of excited delirium are only applied after the fact to get police officers off the hook in cases in which excessive force has resulted in the death of a civilian. The NAACP reported in 2003 that excited delirium diagnoses are provided more often in explaining the deaths of minorities than they are in the deaths of white victims. In 2007, Eric Balaban of the American Civil Liberties Union noted that excited delirium was not recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Psychological Association and that the diagnosis simply served “as a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest” (NPR 2007). Melissa Smith of the American Medical Association confirmed in 2007 that the association had “no official policy” on the supposed condition (ABC News 2007).</p>
<p>Excited delirium is not recognized in Australia by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the Australian Medical Association or any other registered medical body. Neither is it recognized in law. A 2015 case, in which a man who had been declared to have died from excited delirium was overturned by a ruling in the Victorian Coroners Court. The presiding coroner in that case concluded that neither excited delirium nor so called excited delirium syndrome are appropriate or helpful in providing a legitimate medical cause of death (Coroner’s Court of Victoria at Melbourne 2015).</p>
<p>The Burnaby ruling in the Mauricio Facchin case is particularly stunning, and disappointing, given that Vancouver was site of the 2007 police killing of migrant Robert Dziekanski whose death police initially lied about publicly suggesting he suffered excited delirium. Video by a civilian witness showed this claim to be untrue as Dziekanski was following police instructions when he was tased and jumped by police causing his death. During the inquiry into police actions that police psychologist Mike Webster that police have been “brainwashed” by Taser International to justify “ridiculously inappropriate” use of the weapon. Webster referred to excited delirium as a “dubious disorder” pushed by Taser International during its police training (Hall 2008). A 2008 report on taser use by the RCMP, <em>An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</em>, concluded that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the Mounties in the absence of formal approval following consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body (Kiedrowski 2008). Justice Thomas Braidwood concluded the inquiry finding that excited delirium should not be used as part of police use of force training as it is not a legitimate medical condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommendations Based On What?</p>
<p>In the case of the coroner’s inquiry into the police killing of Maurizio Facchin, the coroner’s jury suggested that police receive training in identifying and properly responding to instances of excited delirium. It was also recommended that 911 dispatchers receive such training so that they might identify and inform police of potential excited delirium cases upon dispatch. Finally the jury suggested that officers contact emergency services when a taser is going to be deployed in such cases.</p>
<p>In the case of the police killing of Simon Chung, Provincial Court Judge Lloyd Malin provided two recommendations. In the first he suggested that while Edmonton Police Service mentions excited delirium syndrome in its policy and procedure manual on use of force, officers should also be trained to recognize the symptoms in all situations, not only during arrests. Malin also recommended that officers be trained to call for emergency medical services as soon as excited delirium is suspected. This call should be made regardless of the need for police to restrain an individual (Parsons 2016).</p>
<p>These recommendations are based on the dubious diagnosis of excited delirium and will do little to change police behavior, particularly violent behavior. They will not address police killings of civilians. The recommendations are based on treatment of a social fiction.</p>

       ***<p>In a September 2014 incident near Valemount, British Columbia, RCMP Emergency Response Team members fired several shots killing 51-year-old John Buehler and injuring his daughter Shanna Buehler. All of this happened in an attempt to arrest the man simply for failing to appear in court. Following an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the Criminal Justice Branch in BC decided, for reasons that are not yet clear, not to lay charges against the four officers involved in the multiple shootings and killing. This despite the finding by the IIO investigators that Buehler did not shoot at officers as police claimed. Still the Crown decided not to pursue a case against the officers and little more has been said about the attempt by police to justify the shootings and killing by falsely claiming they were only returning fire. The announcement of no charges was released on October 20, 2016, more than two years after the killing.</p>
       ***<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer’s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consideration of Charges?</p>
<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.” (quoted in Johnstone 2016)</p>
<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Justice for Hudson”</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: “I wouldn’t say I’m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for “Justice For Hudson” to raise awareness about Hudson’s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.</p>
<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: “We’re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism</p>

Tucker was being held in custody while awaiting trial on multiple charges related to alleged attacks on three women at the University of British Columbia in April 2016.      2 men charged in connection with UBC sex assault  Brennan read a statement from Tucker's mother, who described a troubled individual who struggled with violent tendencies and behavioural issues throughout his life.  The statement described an in-custody suicide attempt by Tucker about a month before he died, which also involved on overdose of prescribed opioids.  Brennan said she had tried to talk Tucker out of killing himself and called the Surrey Pretrial Centre July 20, 2016 to warn officials about the suicide threat.  She testified that she told officials to listen to recordings of the phone call she had with Tucker, detailing his plans. 'Enough drugs to kill himself'  Tucker had been staying at a psychiatric facility, Colony Farm, but told his aunt that he was trying to get back to the Surrey Pretrial Centre.

They described Tucker's segregation cell window being scratched or smeared with something that made it difficult to see inside. A surveillance camera had also been damaged. A censored frame grab from the cell video footage shown at the coroner's inquest shows how the camera had been damaged or tampered with to hinder surveillance. (B.C.

The Independent Investigations Office, set up to address the use of lethal force by police in the province has in its few years of existence shown the perils and limitations of such would be oversight efforts. As in other cases issues of independence, and fortitude in the face of police backlash have come to the fore.</p>
<p>There are currently only five police oversight agencies in Canada. This is a small minority in a country with ten provinces and three territories. The first such oversight agency was established in Ontario, the country’s largest province, in 1990. Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is still viewed by many as the model such agency, nationally and, for some, globally, despite ongoing, well documented, structural limitations and continued interference and non-participation by police. The next oversight agency came almost a decade later when the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) was established in 2008. The Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team was set up in 2012, the same year that the IIO was established in British Columbia. In 2013 Manitoba set up the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia was created in response to recommendations resulting from two public inquiries into police involved killings, including the infamous police killing of Robert Dziekanski in which police lied publicly about events of the killing before a civilian video appeared to show police claims to be bold lies. The mandate of the IIO is to probe all police-involved incidents that result in death or serious harm. The IIO currently consists of 34 investigators. This includes team directors, forensics staff, affected-persons liaisons, and public accountability staff.</p>
<p>The first few years of its existence has been rocky, to put it in its nicest possible light. The IIO began operations a year later than planned (Sept. 10, 2012) and over its first few years has suffered a range of problems and missteps. These include questions about its framework, low morale, high attrition, and ongoing concerns about how the office has investigated some of its cases. Allegations that chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal was harassing and bullying staff led to an investigation by the British Columbia government. Stunningly, 22 of the IIO’s 50 employees quit or were fired in the first two years (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>The IIO staff recognize that the first few years have been a struggle and much work still needs to be done. The next chief civilian director of the IIO enters the position in 2017. According to current chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal: “We’re four years old. Hopefully we’re not sticking our fingers in electrical outlets, but we’re still very young, we’re still emerging, we’re still developing. Nobody can say what this organization is really going to look like 10 years from now” (quoted in Saltman 2016). Yet the newly developed directions in IIO training and practices raise real questions about its future as anything approaching an effective police oversight agency.</p>
<p>The IIO has appeared to capitulate to criticism over cases that have found against police officers. Those cases have been responded to by a great deal of public propaganda by police officers, agencies, and supporters. This media flak by police associated sources has been effective in putting the office on the defensive. Senior director of investigations, Patrick Kennedy suggests: “Civilian oversight is challenging because you have to look at it from a different perspective and a different paradigm” (quoted in Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>In response to police initiated criticisms the office has planned a new training program introduced in February 2016 involving the swearing in of seven new investigators. Under the new training program, investigators now complete a six- to eight-week induction and then spend three months training at the Justice Institute of B.C. Yet the Justice Institute is the police training institution in British Columbia. It is part of and central to policing in the province. Instructors are typically police officers, many of whom are currently active on the force. This is in no way independent training and it raises fundamental questions about investigators’ relationships with and commitments to their instructors, the institution, and the police forces in British Columbia. Investigators will work cases for 12 to 18 months before they can act as primary investigators. While the IIO states its hope that the training will help the organization move toward one day being completely staffed by civilians, this raining program largely undermines this stated hope. Notably the “independent” investigators have expressed satisfaction with the new arrangement.</p>
<p>The records related to the cases within the Independent Investigations Office are quite telling: There have been 156 cases investigated by the IIO since the office opened in September 2012. Forty-four cases remain open. There have been 112 cases that have been closed. Of those closed cases, 48 resulted in reports to Crown counsel and 64 resulted in public reports exonerating the officers involved. An improbably low number of seven cases have seen any charges approved by the Crown. Of these, two cases resulted in stays of proceedings, two resulted in pleas, one resulted in an acquittal, and two are pending. The office has probed 29 officer-involved shootings. In 17 cases, the shootings were fatal while the rest of them resulted in serious harm. Between September 2014 and September 2015 alone there were 20 fatalities that the IIO was called to investigate. Twelve of these involved shooting deaths of civilians by police (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>Among the greatest current worries about the IIO has been the backlog of cases that has quickly built up in a short period of time. The office presently has 44 open cases, an incredible 10 of which are more than one year old. This has made things very difficult and painful for victims harmed by police and for families of victims killed by police. It has also put pressure on Crown prosecutors in making decisions about charges, already a rare circumstance in police involved killings. Incredibly, the IIO blames the backlog on the large increase in police involved killings (which the IIO was instituted to help reduce).</p>
<p>There have also been concerns about the limited mandate and limited definitions of police involved harms. Currently domestic violence and sexual assaults by police are not included within the IIO mandate for investigations.</p>

       ***<p>It says plenty about the protections afforded police who kill civilians in Canada that months after a killing even minimal details about the event are not released to public or media. Officers involved are shielded from public scrutiny. Media are not allowed to report the issue in a manner consistent with an open and democratic system. Loved ones are left to ask painful questions. And live with excruciating silence from the agencies involved and responsible for providing answers. This serves to protect the system and allows police agencies time to reconstruct events, and their stories, to suit their own interests.</p>
<p>Seven months after Hudson Brooks, 20, was shot down in the street outside of an RCMP detachment in South Surrey, BC, the young man’s family has received no answers and few insights into how or why their loved one came to be a victim of police violence. This despite repeated requests made to the RCMP and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the province’s police oversight body for information. This despite public appeals for disclosure from the RCMP, IIO, and local politicians, including two marches involving hundreds of supporters.</p>
<p>What is known for sure is that Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and killed by an RCMP officer or officers outside the force’s South Surrey detachment. The IIO, in one of its few informational statements on the killing, has also confirmed that only a police service weapon was recovered at the scene. No other weapons were present. This is crucial because RCMP, as is often the case in police killings of civilians, initially suggested in media reports that there had been an exchange of shots between Brooks and the RCMP resulting in a gunshot wound to one officer. It now appears that the officer’s injury was either self-inflicted or a result of friendly fire. Brooks was not even wearing a t-shirt at the time he was shot and killed. He had no weapon or place to hide it.</p>
<p>Later police tried to claim that Brooks was suicidal. As in other recent cases in BC the RCMP sought to disparage and blame the victim (as if being suicidal could legitimize police killing someone—only in that authoritarian culture of impunity). Brooks family and friends have been clear and consistent that the young man was happy, optimistic, with a bright future.</p>
<p>Incredibly, neither Surrey’s Mayor Linda Hepner nor local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) for Surrey-White Rock Gordon Hogg have contacted the Brooks family whether to provide information or even to offer condolences. In the words of Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks’ mother: “Our son was shot down in the streets of Surrey—they haven’t reached out to me. Where is the compassion? A young man loses his life and we’re not contacted” (quoted in Holmes 2016). A stunning lack of compassion, and basic human decency, which would certainly not be the case in the event of a police officer being killed by a civilian.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ mother has lived with indescribable pain since her son was killed by RCMP officers early in the morning on July 18, 2015. Following the February 2016 march commemorating her son, Jennifer Brooks asked: “Every moment of everyday, I wonder, I get up, first thing I think of is what happened to Hudson? How did this escalate to the point that lethal force was used on my son, my unarmed son?” (quoted in Beja 2016).<br />
There is much for the RCMP to answer for. Jennifer Brooks needs to know. The RCMP need to answer: “I don’t know why my unarmed son was shot multiple times. Why was lethal force used on Hudson? Why was he shot five to seven times? The silence is killing me. I have no answers. It’s devastating” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Outrageously, the IIO points to an increase in officer-involved shootings, and the strain on resources they cause, as leading to a backlog of investigations that has left many families of victims of police violence seeking answers. According to Marten Youssef, spokesperson for the IIO: “Our timeliness has suffered, and that is partly due to a spike in officer-involved shootings and officer-involved fatalities” (quoted in Beja 2016). According to provincial records, between September 2014 and December 2015, there were 20 officer-involved fatalities, 12 were firearm-related, in British Columbia. That compares to one recorded fatal shooting by police in 2013 and three fatal shootings by police in 2012. The rise in killings of civilians by police in BC has led the IIO to hire more investigators to deal with the back-log. At public expense. Yet the activities of the IIO since their inception suggest that they remain largely toothless in holding killer cop accountable or in reigning in murderous forces in the province. In effect they offer no deterrence for killer cops and minimal real oversight.</p>
<p>Jennifer Brooks suggests that the increase in police-involved shootings over the previous year points to a pressing need for better training. In her view: “When there is someone in distress, the first thing to do is not shoot, not use lethal force” (quoted in Beja 2016). In the words of Hudson Brooks’ brother Beaudry: “Too many don’t have proper training and aren’t ready for the position they are in. It leads to things like this. It shouldn’t have happened” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Others would suggest that disarming the police in British Columbia might be a necessary step. Others call for ending the RCMP contracts in sub/urban centers like Surrey.</p>
<p>The silence and disengagement from public requests for answers is telling in the context of RCMP targeting of Surrey for increased policing and stated efforts toward community mobilization. Indeed the RCMP has long viewed Surrey as a site of force expansion and budgetary increase. They are banking on Surrey, and fear campaigns and moral panics targeting the city, in a context in which crime rates on the whole are declining consistently over years (with associated threats to police budgets). RCMP have established a public relations outreach officer in Surrey staffed by an officer who is also part of the RCMP campaign to gain a foothold in local communities by securing a faculty position in the local university, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, that enrolls the greatest proportion of Surrey post-secondary students. This has been central in efforts to recruit younger local residents while gaining access to informants, friends and family, in the neighborhoods of Surrey.</p>
<p>Yet when families ask for answers about the RCMP killing their children, nothing.</p>

The inquest ran Feb. 19 to 22 in Burnaby and was related to the death of Gurwinder (Gogi) Singh Mann, who suffered an injury in 2013 while in custody at the Donnaconna Institute near Quebec City and was transferred the following year to Pacific Institution in Abbotsford.  Mann was under the care of the medical unit there until his death on Dec. 26, 2015 at the age of 39.  The inquest reviewed the circumstances of how Mann died, with the jury making recommendations to prevent future similar deaths.  According to the verdict posted online, Mann’s cause of death was an anoxic brain injury, meaning he did not die from a blow to the head.  The death is listed as accidental, but no further details are provided.  RELATED: Man serving life sentence for gang-related murder dies in Abbotsford prison  RELATED: Convicted killer denied hearing for earlier parole eligibility  Common causes of anoxic brain injury, according to online medical reports, include a stroke, a drug overdose, a sudden blow to the windpipe or being choked unconscious.  The jury made three recommendations to the chief of health services at Pacific Institution:  – Review the policies and procedures around establishing interdisciplinary health team meetings maintained on a regular schedule.  – Review ways to create a practical, easy-to-use charting system for all disciplines.  – Regularly review, audit and implement procedures to ensure ongoing training of staff.  An additional recommendation was made jointly to the chief of health services and the warden at Pacific Institution: Consider developing procedures regarding co-ordination between corrections staff and health care professionals.  Mann began serving a life sentence in May 2003 for the gang-related killing of Gurpreet Sohi, 20, who was gunned down in his Delta basement in 2000.  Also serving a life sentence for Sohi’s murder is Ravinder (Robbie) Soomel, 39, who was convicted at the same time as Mann in 2003.  In 2010, Soomel was sentenced in relation to another earlier killing – that of 18-year-old Jason Herle, who was gunned down by two men hiding in the bushes as he was leaving his parents’ King Road home in Abbotsford with his girlfriend in November 1997.  Soomel and co-accused Tajinder Bains each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in that case.",Pacific Institute,,,,Gurwinder Singh Mann,Georgia St (2017),Added,2.0,None,2019.05.21,None,None,,,,https://www.abbynews.com/news/coroners-inquest-concludes-into-death-of-gangster-in-abbotsford-prison/

The Independent Investigations Office, set up to address the use of lethal force by police in the province has in its few years of existence shown the perils and limitations of such would be oversight efforts. As in other cases issues of independence, and fortitude in the face of police backlash have come to the fore.</p>
<p>There are currently only five police oversight agencies in Canada. This is a small minority in a country with ten provinces and three territories. The first such oversight agency was established in Ontario, the country’s largest province, in 1990. Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is still viewed by many as the model such agency, nationally and, for some, globally, despite ongoing, well documented, structural limitations and continued interference and non-participation by police. The next oversight agency came almost a decade later when the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) was established in 2008. The Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team was set up in 2012, the same year that the IIO was established in British Columbia. In 2013 Manitoba set up the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia was created in response to recommendations resulting from two public inquiries into police involved killings, including the infamous police killing of Robert Dziekanski in which police lied publicly about events of the killing before a civilian video appeared to show police claims to be bold lies. The mandate of the IIO is to probe all police-involved incidents that result in death or serious harm. The IIO currently consists of 34 investigators. This includes team directors, forensics staff, affected-persons liaisons, and public accountability staff.</p>
<p>The first few years of its existence has been rocky, to put it in its nicest possible light. The IIO began operations a year later than planned (Sept. 10, 2012) and over its first few years has suffered a range of problems and missteps. These include questions about its framework, low morale, high attrition, and ongoing concerns about how the office has investigated some of its cases. Allegations that chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal was harassing and bullying staff led to an investigation by the British Columbia government. Stunningly, 22 of the IIO’s 50 employees quit or were fired in the first two years (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>The IIO staff recognize that the first few years have been a struggle and much work still needs to be done. The next chief civilian director of the IIO enters the position in 2017. According to current chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal: “We’re four years old. Hopefully we’re not sticking our fingers in electrical outlets, but we’re still very young, we’re still emerging, we’re still developing. Nobody can say what this organization is really going to look like 10 years from now” (quoted in Saltman 2016). Yet the newly developed directions in IIO training and practices raise real questions about its future as anything approaching an effective police oversight agency.</p>
<p>The IIO has appeared to capitulate to criticism over cases that have found against police officers. Those cases have been responded to by a great deal of public propaganda by police officers, agencies, and supporters. This media flak by police associated sources has been effective in putting the office on the defensive. Senior director of investigations, Patrick Kennedy suggests: “Civilian oversight is challenging because you have to look at it from a different perspective and a different paradigm” (quoted in Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>In response to police initiated criticisms the office has planned a new training program introduced in February 2016 involving the swearing in of seven new investigators. Under the new training program, investigators now complete a six- to eight-week induction and then spend three months training at the Justice Institute of B.C. Yet the Justice Institute is the police training institution in British Columbia. It is part of and central to policing in the province. Instructors are typically police officers, many of whom are currently active on the force. This is in no way independent training and it raises fundamental questions about investigators’ relationships with and commitments to their instructors, the institution, and the police forces in British Columbia. Investigators will work cases for 12 to 18 months before they can act as primary investigators. While the IIO states its hope that the training will help the organization move toward one day being completely staffed by civilians, this raining program largely undermines this stated hope. Notably the “independent” investigators have expressed satisfaction with the new arrangement.</p>
<p>The records related to the cases within the Independent Investigations Office are quite telling: There have been 156 cases investigated by the IIO since the office opened in September 2012. Forty-four cases remain open. There have been 112 cases that have been closed. Of those closed cases, 48 resulted in reports to Crown counsel and 64 resulted in public reports exonerating the officers involved. An improbably low number of seven cases have seen any charges approved by the Crown. Of these, two cases resulted in stays of proceedings, two resulted in pleas, one resulted in an acquittal, and two are pending. The office has probed 29 officer-involved shootings. In 17 cases, the shootings were fatal while the rest of them resulted in serious harm. Between September 2014 and September 2015 alone there were 20 fatalities that the IIO was called to investigate. Twelve of these involved shooting deaths of civilians by police (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>Among the greatest current worries about the IIO has been the backlog of cases that has quickly built up in a short period of time. The office presently has 44 open cases, an incredible 10 of which are more than one year old. This has made things very difficult and painful for victims harmed by police and for families of victims killed by police. It has also put pressure on Crown prosecutors in making decisions about charges, already a rare circumstance in police involved killings. Incredibly, the IIO blames the backlog on the large increase in police involved killings (which the IIO was instituted to help reduce).</p>
<p>There have also been concerns about the limited mandate and limited definitions of police involved harms. Currently domestic violence and sexual assaults by police are not included within the IIO mandate for investigations.</p>

Photo from an online tribute to Adam Palsson. Article content  Colby Palsson is looking for answers after his son Adam was killed last month while in the custody of B.C. Corrections.  Adam, 27, was serving a 13-month sentence at the Fraser Regional Correctional Centre for stealing a car and driving dangerously.  He was in protective custody, meaning he should have been secure, the elder Palsson said in an interview Tuesday.  The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, which is looking into the slaying, said Adam died after an altercation on the afternoon of Feb. 27.  “IHIT didn’t really say any names to me. They just told me that at this point there are no charges being laid,” Palsson said.  He said he’s learned the attack on his son happened during lockdown for a shift change of the guards at the Maple Ridge institution.  “I believe they should be watched a little better when guards go on breaks or when they are on lockdown. You are supposed to be in your rooms and you’re supposed to be safe in your rooms. But how safe are you when there is nobody around to make sure you’re safe?”  IHIT Sgt. Stephanie Ashton said Tuesday that there’s no update in the investigation.  Earlier she said “IHIT investigators are working in partnership with corrections personnel at FRCC to determine the circumstances leading up to this man’s death.”  “Investigators believe there may be witnesses with information about what led up to this in-custody death and ask anyone who has not already spoken to police to come forward,” she said.  B.C. Corrections official Cindy Rose offered condolences to Adam’s family in an emailed statement to The Vancouver Sun.  “Any death in custody is a tragedy and I can assure you that each and every one is taken extremely seriously,” Rose said. “While we certainly appreciate that the individual’s family is seeking answers at this difficult time, we can only offer very limited details given the investigations that are currently underway.”  She said the government agency takes “every precaution to ensure inmates’ safety.”  “We will be looking at the circumstances of this incident to determine if there are ways to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.”  Palsson learned of Adam’s death from a friend on Facebook. At first he thought it was a practical joke.  “He died from a smash to the head. So I don’t know if he fell down and hit his head on something or his head was smashed into something or if it was a hit,” Palsson said. “It is still kind of surreal. I hadn’t talked to Adam in a couple of months. I still get this feeling I am going to see him in a month or so, because he was supposed to be out soon.”  His son was a prolific car thief who struggled with a drug problem, he said.  “He had promise. He just kind of lost his way a bit with the party life, I guess, and doing things like stealing cars. Just minor breaches and missing his appointments,” said the grieving dad.  He said he’d like to see changes to jail regulations or even laws, if necessary, to ensure inmates at provincial jails are kept safe.  “If I can step in and make some changes I will — positive changes for the future,” Palsson said. “I don’t want this to ever happen to anybody else just because they aren’t looking after them properly in jail.”",Fraser Regional Correctional Facility,,,,Adam Palsson,Georgia St (2017),Added,2.0,None,,None,None,,, ***177_KCC,https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dad-looking-for-answers-after-son-killed-in-maple-ridge-prison

Niagara Regional Police said officers were called to the area of Lundy’s Lane and Corwin Avenue near Niagara Falls at approximately 1:30 p.m. for a report of a suspected impaired driver.  According to the SIU, the vehicle fled when officers arrived in the area  “Officers followed the vehicle and made numerous attempts to stop it,” the SIU said in a statement.  Near Line 3 and the Niagara River Parkway, the vehicle went into a ditch and came to a stop.  An interaction followed between police and an adult male and he was subsequently shot by one of the officers, according to the SIU.  Police said the man was transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries where he was later pronounced dead.  “Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case. At this time, one NRPS officer has been designated as a subject officer,” the SIU said. “In addition, two officers with NRPS and two officers with Niagara Parks Police have been designated as witness officers.”  Local roads were shut down in the area for the investigation.  The SIU is an arm’s-length agency called in to investigate whenever police are involved in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault.  Detectives from Niagara Regional Police Service will also be investigating the incident.  An autopsy has been scheduled and investigators are currently working to identify the man.       ***
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harms in Ontario, is investigating the police killing of a man in Niagara-on-the-Lake on the afternoon of January 5, 2021. A Niagara Regional Police presence has been reported in the area of Line 3 and the Niagara Parkway.</p>



<p>This is a breaking situation and no further details are currently available.</p>



<p>It is now reported that Niagara Regional Police officers were responding to reports of an impaired driver and located a vehicle around 2:20 PM. It has also been reported that a call was made to police regarding two people sleeping in a car. It has not been confirmed that the person killed was related to the call or that the person was driving while impaired. In any event no one should be shot and killed for being impaired or for sleeping in a car.</p>



<p>The SIU has assigned four investigators and three forensic investigators to examine the killing. One NRPS officer has been designated as a subject officer. Two NRPS officers and two Niagara Parks Police officers have been designated as witness officers.</p>
       
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has publicly identified the man shot and killed by Niagara Regional Police Service (NRPS) officers on January 5 as 27-year-old Martin Gordyn. Details remain sketchy at this point. Initial reports suggest that police were called regarding someone being impaired and/or two people sleeping in a car. The killing occurred near a park trail.</p>



<p>This appears to have been a major operation given the number of officers involved and the presence of three police forces. According to the SIU, one NRPS officer has been designated as a subject officer. In addition, 23 officers with NRPS, three officers with Niagara Parks Police, and five officers with the Ontario Provincial Police have been designated as witness officers.</p>

Then he read on Facebook that there was a serious incident up on the East Bluff, a wooded area just outside of the small Manitoulin Island town.   ""Well, when they said the East Bluff, the first thing that came to mind, yeah,"" says the 76-year-old.  ""Probably Gary.""  His nephew Gary Brohman and Ontario Provincial Police Constable Marc Hovingh shot at each other that morning in a trailer where Brohman had been living.   Both men later died in hospital.  Police say Hovingh and another officer went to the trailer to follow up on a ""property dispute"", but, other than that, few details have been released, as the province's Special Investigations Unit has taken over the case.  Blue says Brohman had just moved to the trailer in the past few weeks. Before that they lived for several years in the same apartment building in Gore Bay.

""He was on his deathbed, and I promised him I was going to stay strong for him and I'm going to fight for him, I'm going to get justice for him, and I can't break that promise now,"" she told CBC News.  ""That's what's keeping me together ... I feel like he's with me all the time now. He's watching over me. He wants to see the justice.""  With a handful of family members behind her, all wearing Justice for Jay shirts, Mackenzie stood in front of Hamilton's city hall at 9 a.m. on Thursday to speak about her father. He died after police shot him two weeks ago.  The 18-year-old's father was in a convenience store parking lot at Cannon Street East and Gage Avenue North on July 7.  Police initially said they were responding to a call about an active domestic incident when they saw Jason, 42, with a firearm in a vehicle.  Mackenzie and her lawyer, Wade Poziomka, declined to comment on the domestic incident, saying it is a lot of ""what we're in the dark about.""  Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which is now investigating Peterson's death, says police approached the vehicle and two officers fired their guns at Peterson after ""an interaction.""  Mackenzie said he was shot twice — once in the arm and once in the back of the head.  ""Aren't police trained to not kill? Aren't they trained to serve and protect? If that is true, why was he shot in the back of the head? Why was pulling their guns their first option when they had many other ways to detain him?""   ""When you're shot in the back of the head, there's no saving you. They were shooting to kill, I feel like.""  Jason's mother, Lucy, stood beside Mackenzie throughout. She too was furious about the gunshot to the back of the head, wondering why police couldn't hit another body part like his shoulder.       ***<p>A 42-year-old man shot by Hamilton police on July 7, died in hospital on July 8, 2020.

The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

       <p>Killer cops, their forces, and their police associations are regularly coming up with euphemisms and bogus “conditions” to excuse or legitimize their killings. The litany includes “excited delirium,” “suicide by cop,” and the mystical “sudden death.” The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians is investigating a case that police are calling “sudden death” in Chatham, Ontario on July 26, 2017.</p>
<p>Sometime on the night of July 25, Chatham-Kent police responded to a 911 call allegedly involving a domestic dispute. According to the SIU police remained outside the house on Greenfield Lane for quite some time.</p>
<p>Then the storyline jumps dramatically with no explanation. The SIU reports police entered the house at around 7:00 AM and—huge jump here—a 52-year old man, since identified as Shawn Davis, was pronounced dead at the scene (killed?, found dead?, etc.?). No one is saying. But sudden death does not cut it.</p>
<p>CKPS Constable Kelly Helbin said police would not release any other information. This only adds to the sense of police acting suspiciously in this case.</p>
       ***<p>A coroner’s inquest into the police shooting and killing of 21-year-old Kwasi Skene-Peters on July 25, 2015 has been announced. On August 2, 2017, Dr. James Edwards, the regional supervising coroner for Central Region (Toronto Easy office) gave notice of the inquest.</p>
<p>An SIU (Special Investigations Unit) investigation of the killing concluded that Toronto police had been instructed to set up surveillance at the Tryst nightclub on reports that Skene-Peters would be present. The Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) (ironically) was also on hand to provide “additional officer support” and were parked in a nearby alley. Skene-Peters was in his car around 3 AM when a civilian vehicle boxed him in and police decided to make a charge on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Notably, a witness who spoke with CBC Toronto at the time reported that between 20 to 30 shots were fired and he did not hear police make any demands toward Skene-Peters before opening fire on him (CBC News 2017). Upon hearing the shots the witness fled in fear. Could a less dramatic approach by police avoided taking of a life in this case? Particularly given that Skene-Peters was in a vehicle and boxed in and police had positioning.</p>
<p>The SIU report noted that both of the officers who shot Skene-Peters declined to participate in the SIU investigation. There is currently no mechanism used to make killer cops comply with SIU investigations.</p>

       ***<p>The 2017 coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Michael MacIsaac has already heard dubious testimony from the officer who shot him, Brian Taylor. As the inquest continues, on July 26, another police officer, Durham Regional Police Constable Mark Brown, has added to the questionable police testimony by suggesting that the dying victim played a part in his own death by actively resisting help.  Brown was the first to respond to a 911 call involving Michael MacIsaac on that morning on December 2, 2013. MacIsaac was shot by Taylor while he was experiencing effects of an epileptic seizure and was naked in the street near his home.</p>
<p>In Brown&#8217;s own testimony: “I remember him saying stuff, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The only thing I understood when performing first aid, was MacIsaac said ‘pain’ (quoted in McLaughlin 2017). That seems clear enough. But the cop wants the jury to believe the dying man did not want the pain to stop.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family lawyer, Roy Wellington questioned Constable Brown about his claim that MacIsaac resisted help. Asked Wellington: “Does it strike you as odd that someone would not want to be touched after being shot by the same people” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)? Brown could not offer such empathetic insight.</p>
<p>Family members in attendance at the inquest were dumbfounded at the officer’s testimony. Said Brian MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne:  “I can’t imagine what was going through Michael’s head, and know the pain must have been horrible. But to tell him after the fact, we are here to help you? It’s ridiculous, ridiculous to me. Why didn&#8217;t you help him before?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017).  Joanne MacIsaac suggested that the officer’s testimony was not close to believable. She continued in frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“His narrative of what happened has got to be, in my opinion, fabricated. To say Michael was actively resisting when he’s naked, cold on the ground and you&#8217;re pushing in on his abdomen after he has been shot, to use the phrase ‘he’s actively resisting,’ my god what is the matter with these people?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under cross examination by Anita Szigeti, a lawyer with Toronto’s Empowerment Council for people with mental health issues, Constable Brown, an officer with 14 years of experience on the force had undertaken only one week of mental health training ever and that had occurred a decade before the killing of Michael MacIsaac. Brown had to admit on the stand that his training was not adequate.</p>

At some point during the police encounter the man suffered a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
       ***<p>After five years, a date has finally been set for the inquest into the death in police custody of 37-year-old Ina Matawapit, at the Weagamow Lake Nursing Station in North Caribou Lake First Nation, in northern Ontario. Matawapit died on June 7, 2012 after a transfer from a police vehicle while in custody. Matawapit’s case was one of several that have been egregiously delayed due to widespread problems with Indigenous representation on jury rolls. This ongoing, entrenched problem has characterized criminal justice systems and inquests in the Canadian state context. At least 20 cases in Ontario have been delayed by province’s jury roll problems.</p>
<p>The inquest into Matawapit’s death is mandatory under the Coroners Act because she was in custody at the time. The inquest will examine the circumstances surrounding her death by hearing from about 10 witnesses over the scheduled six days of proceedings. Dr. Michael Wilson will be presiding coroner during the inquest which is scheduled to begin at 9:30 AM on February 12, 2018 at the Days Inn in Sioux Lookout, Ontario.</p>

In Canada as in the United States Black people are disproportionately killed by police, though less attention is given to lethal police violence in Canada compared with the US. On June 22, 2018, Olando Brown, a thirty-two-year-old Black man, a father with an 11-year-old daughter, died during an arrest by police in the town of Barrie, Ontario.</p>
<p>The arrest took place around 2:30 PM near the Tim Hortons donut shop at the Five Points hotel in downtown Barrie. According to witnesses Brown was tased multiple times by Barrie police officers. Questions are being asked why he was not given immediate medical attention rather than being processed by Barrie police. Brown went into medical distress while being booked by police at the police station. He was pronounced dead at hospital. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is examining Brown’s killing.</p>
<p>The violence inflicted by police against Black people in Canada has long been disproportionate. The killing of Olando Brown, a Black man, must be placed within this context. Olando Brown’s aunt, Barbara South, says her nephew was known as someone who would always lend a helping hand and suggests that he would have never died in custody if he was white. She is very clear in her assessment of what police did to Olando Brown:  “My nephew was murdered. There’s no doubt about that” (quoted in CTV 2018).</p>
<p>A cellphone video taken by a witness shows officers physically confronting Brown and using tasers to take him down. The person holding the camera says Brown was trying to lay down and had already been hit with a taser. Brown is seen getting off the ground, where he appears to be punched and hit with a taser again. Witness Lance Freeman reports: “They asked him to see his ID and before he even had a chance to pull his ID out, the one guy just kicked him, (and) the other guy just starting Tasing him,” said Lance Freeman, who witnessed the arrest” (quoted in CTV 2018).</p>
<p>A man, who identifies himself only as a longtime friend of Olando Brown is among those asking questions about police actions. In his words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I knew him personally and he was a very kind person, like he would give the shirt off his back. It&#8217;s an unfortunate situation and he didn’t deserve it. To be honest with you, I don’t know the incident. All I know is apparently the cops came down on him when he was over there (behind the bushes behind Tim Hortons) and that’s the story. From that it was just Taser after Taser after Taser. I kind of had faith in the police here because this was supposed to only happen in America, not here. It shouldn’t happen anywhere, but you only see things like that on the U.S. news, but here especially in small-town, nice Canada, it&#8217;s not right.” (quoted in Gibson 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown’s friend asks why medical attention was not given following the multiple deployments of taser:  “What is the protocol when you Taser someone and especially after that many? Why wasn’t he just taken to hospital for a check-up? He would have been in handcuffs, he wasn’t going anywhere and the police could have seen if he was OK and then processed him” (quoted in Gibson 2018).</p>
<p>He also noted the over-policing of people in that area of Barrie. There is no way for people to trust police given their actions he concludes. In his words: &#8220;But, now how we are supposed to feel when the cops come around and try to talk to us, how we supposed to trust them? It&#8217;s unfortunate all around because a man died who didn’t deserve it and now people may start to feel uneasy” (quoted in Gibson 2018).</p>
<p>The reason for the arrest has not been disclosed by Barrie police and has not been confirmed publicly.</p>

       *<p>The 2017 coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Michael MacIsaac has already heard dubious testimony from the officer who shot him, Brian Taylor. As the inquest continues, on July 26, another police officer, Durham Regional Police Constable Mark Brown, has added to the questionable police testimony by suggesting that the dying victim played a part in his own death by actively resisting help.  Brown was the first to respond to a 911 call involving Michael MacIsaac on that morning on December 2, 2013. MacIsaac was shot by Taylor while he was experiencing effects of an epileptic seizure and was naked in the street near his home.</p>
<p>In Brown&#8217;s own testimony: “I remember him saying stuff, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The only thing I understood when performing first aid, was MacIsaac said ‘pain’ (quoted in McLaughlin 2017). That seems clear enough. But the cop wants the jury to believe the dying man did not want the pain to stop.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family lawyer, Roy Wellington questioned Constable Brown about his claim that MacIsaac resisted help. Asked Wellington: “Does it strike you as odd that someone would not want to be touched after being shot by the same people” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)? Brown could not offer such empathetic insight.</p>
<p>Family members in attendance at the inquest were dumbfounded at the officer’s testimony. Said Brian MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne:  “I can’t imagine what was going through Michael’s head, and know the pain must have been horrible. But to tell him after the fact, we are here to help you? It’s ridiculous, ridiculous to me. Why didn&#8217;t you help him before?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017).  Joanne MacIsaac suggested that the officer’s testimony was not close to believable. She continued in frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“His narrative of what happened has got to be, in my opinion, fabricated. To say Michael was actively resisting when he’s naked, cold on the ground and you&#8217;re pushing in on his abdomen after he has been shot, to use the phrase ‘he’s actively resisting,’ my god what is the matter with these people?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under cross examination by Anita Szigeti, a lawyer with Toronto’s Empowerment Council for people with mental health issues, Constable Brown, an officer with 14 years of experience on the force had undertaken only one week of mental health training ever and that had occurred a decade before the killing of Michael MacIsaac. Brown had to admit on the stand that his training was not adequate.</p>

Mr. Njoko died on May 8, but his death was only confirmed by the Special Investigations Unit on June 3. There has been no public explanation for the delay in this.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating. They report that London police responded to 85 Walnut Street on May 4 at around 11:15 PM on a call of a person in distress. Officers entered an apartment on the 15th floor and, at some point, the victim “fell” from a balcony. He was taken to hospital in critical condition and died there four days later.</p>
<p>This is the second Black person to have been killed in what is reported publicly as a fall from a balcony during a police operation in Ontario in May alone. On May 27, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Black woman, was killed in a “fall” from an apartment balcony in Toronto. Family members and witnesses report that she was shoved off the balcony by Toronto police. Because police control the information that is released when they kill, their version of events must be treated with skepticism and there is a real need to hear from witnesses, if any were present.</p>
<p>Notably, both of these deaths involved police interventions against someone in distress. Police are not suitable for mental health care or interacting with people in distress. Proper health supports and care are needed but are denied resources when those resources go instead to police budgets.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned one subject officer and three witness officers to its probe. One might ask why the SIU has designated one subject officer if the incident was straightforwardly a “fall.”</p>

The Special Investigations Unit says Leslie Hegedus was the man shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police officers on July 15.  The SIU says officers were called to a grocery store around 9:25 a.m. where Hegedus was allegedly assaulting people inside.  It says Hegedus left the store and was followed by police officers who later had an ""interaction"" with the man where two officers fired on him.  The SIU says it has recovered a gun from the scene and has also taken the two officers' guns and all three were sent for analysis.  The agency says those two officers have consented to be interviewed and investigators have also interviewed five civilian witnesses and four other officers.       <p>The Special Investigations Unit has publicly identified Leslie Hegedus as the 73-year-old man shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police officers on July 15 at a residence north of Haliburton.</p>
<p>The killing was earlier reported <a href=""https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2020/07/16/ontario-provincial-police-shoot-and-kill-73-year-old-man-july-15-2020/"">here</a>.</p>
       ***<p>Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officers shot and killed a 73-year-old man outside a residence north of Haliburton. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating. According to the SIU, police allege that the man assaulted people at a grocery store in Minden (several kilometers away). No further details about the alleged assault(s) have been released at this time.</p>
<p>The SIU report that the OPP were called to the Valu-mart grocery store on Highway 35 in Minden at around 9:30 AM. A man left the grocery store and drove away in a vehicle. Police claim an officer observed this and after a run of the vehicle’s licence plate, went directly to the associated residence.</p>
<p>Outside the residence police shot and killed the man. He was pronounced dead at hospital around noon.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned four investigators and two forensic investigators to examine the case.</p>
       ***<p>Clive Mensah, a 30-year-old Black man, has been identified as the person killed by Peel Regional Police in Mississauga, Ontario, on November 20, 2019. Mr. Mensah’s family came forward publicly with this information on July 21, 2020, partly inspired by the growing attention to police killings of Black and Indigenous people in Canada and the Black Lives Matter movement. Those mobilizations have brought a focus on police killings of people experiencing mental health crises or as part of police &#8220;wellness checks&#8221; (which are not about wellness at all).</p>
<p>They report that since their loved one’s killing in 2019, they have heard almost nothing from investigators with the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). They are desperate for answers about why police killed their family member, who was unarmed and known to struggle with mental health issues.</p>
<p>Hospital records from the killing show that Mensah was “Tased approximately six times.” He was found lying on the ground and handcuffed by paramedics. The hospital report also records that paramedics faced a delay in reaching the victim because “police cruisers blocked roadway to scene.” Paramedics reportedly had to park between 15 to 18 meters away from where Mr. Mensah lay.</p>
<p>Here was the initial Killer Cops Canada report at the time:</p>
<p>“A 30-year-old man has died after being tasered by Peel Regional Police in Mississauga, Ontario (Greater Toronto Area), during an aggressive arrest.</p>
<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, Peel Regional Police say they were called to Runningbrook Drive in Mississauga at around 3:15 AM on report of a “suspicious male causing a disturbance.” Officers allegedly encountered the man in the backyard of a residence and, according to the SIU, some type of “struggle ensued.”</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon reports: “As part of the struggle, several use-of-force options were used, including the deployment of a conducted energy weapon.” The man was taken into custody and soon after lost consciousness. According to Hudon, the victim was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead shortly around 4:19 AM.</p>
<p>No other details have yet been released publicly, including the nature of force or compliance measures used by police against the victim during the fatal encounter and arrest.</p>
<p>This is the second death in Mississauga in months involving conducted energy weapons. The SIU is still investigating the death of a 34-year-old man when police used a stun gun against him on September 10, 2019. These are not “non-lethal” weapons as has been shown in numerous cases.”</p>

The inquest will examine the events surrounding the deaths of the two men and make recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths.

The killer cop was granted bail by an appeal court judge the same day. Romano plans to appeal both the sentence and the conviction. Carla Abogado’s family left the appeal court in tears after Romano was granted permission to appeal.</p>
<p>Detective-Constable Romano killed 18-year-old Carla Abogado, striking her with his unmarked police truck at 115 km/h in a 60 km/ zone. She was crossing the street to go home after stepping off a bus at Warden Avenue and St. Clair Avenue East on February 12, 2014.</p>
<p>Romano was speeding to catch up with a police surveillance team after he had lagged behind. The court heard that the team was not in any danger or on an urgent case and the speeding by Romano was in no way necessary or justifiable.</p>
<p>This was the third time Romano has gone to trial for the killing. The first trial resulted in a deadlocked jury and in the second case Romano was found not guilty.</p>
<p>The judge in this third trial, Superior Court judge Brian O’Marra, went soft on Romano in sentencing, taking the perspective of the cop, as the courts often do. Judge O&#8217;Marra disagreed with the crown assessment that Romano had not shown remorse for the killing. Incredibly, Judge O’Marra called the crown’s request for a 12 month sentence “excessive.” This may be so only in terms of sentences for cops as the state will generally find ways to protect the state.</p>
<p>Romano is still employed by the York Regional Police and being paid by the public. The killer cop was placed on administrative duties following the criminal charge and the police service have confirmed that Romano will continue in those duties, pending the outcome of the appeal. Romano has taken the copaganda approach followed by many killer cops and their associations, and propped up by servile cop promoting criminologists, of claiming PTSD as a result of his killing someone.</p>
<p>Carla Abogado’s family had previously filed a $2.2-million lawsuit against the York Regional Police Service. That civil case that is still ongoing.</p>
       *<p>On February 12, 2014, York Regional Detective Remo Romano struck and killed 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha “Carla” Abogado while driving at speeds of 115 km/h in a 60 km/h zone on a busy Toronto street. January 17, 2018, found Romano on trial for the third time for the killing.</p>
<p>His first trial in May 2016 ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. He was acquitted in a second trial later that year but the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a retrial based on flaw’s in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. Romano is pleading not guilty. At the outset of the current trial, Superior Court Justice Todd Ducharme told the jury not to research the case, including what happened in the previous proceedings.</p>
<p>Detective Romano struck Abogado while she was crossing mid-block to her family’s home on the south side of St. Clair Avenue East, on her way home from a part-time job. Romano was speeding eastward on St. Clair Ave. E., trying to catch up with other police surveillance members of Project Litterbox, a YRP surveillance investigation into a series of non-violent commercial break-ins where around $500,000 in cosmetics and perfumes had been stolen. He was driving an unmarked truck with no sirens or flashing lights. Romano was trying to catch up to the other officers because he had been at the station retrieving another officer’s firearm that had been forgotten in a desk drawer.</p>
<p>According to the opening statement by Crown attorney Rebecca Schwartz, Romano was driving 115 km/hr in a 60 km/hr zone near a seniors’ health centre. Detective William Newton, who travelled in a police vehicle behind Romano, stated that no arrests were imminent as they sped along the busy avenue. He said that Romano was simply “trying to catch up to the action” (Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>Witness Dorota Taylor saw two police vehicles speed past her. In her testimony: “I thought they were racing because of how close they were to each other and the speed that they were going” (quoted in Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>The jury was told that a senior collision reconstructionist from the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, will testify that if Romano had  been doing even 80 km/hr that night (instead of nearly twice the legal limit) he would have been able to avoid hitting Abogado.</p>
<p>We need to remember that killer cop Romano was speeding at twice the legal limit with no lights or sirens to catch up with surveillance team members who were working on a case protecting wealth for private companies, not responding to any immediate threat (and certainly no violent one) to the public. He simply wanted to be part of “the action.” And he killed Natasha Abogado to do so.</p>

       *<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano, a York police officer, will be headed to trial for a third time on charges of dangerous driving causing death for the killing of 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado in February 2014. Romano (45) was on duty and behind the wheel of an undercover police pickup truck when he struck Natasha Abogado as she attempted to cross St. Clair Avenue East around 8 PM.</p>
<p>Romano was traveling at a speed of least 109 kilometers per hour in a 60-km/hr zone. He was reportedly trying to catch up to other members of his surveillance team, not I active pursuit of anyone.</p>
<p>Romano was tried in May 2016, but a jury was did not come to a unanimous verdict after a few days of deliberating, resulting in a mistrial. Romano was tried again in September 2016 and a jury acquitted him of dangerous driving causing death. Following that decision, the Crown prosecutor filed an appeal, citing issues with the way in which the judge directed the jury to come to its verdict (Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>On September 28, 2017, a panel of three court of appeal judges agreed with the Crown and ordered a new trial. They found that the trial judge, Justice Brian O’Marra, did wrongly explain the dangerous driving law to the jury. Specifically, the judge incorrectly instructed the jurors not only to focus on how Romano’s actions as a driver caused Abogado’s death, but also how the victim Abogado herself might have been at fault (Beattie 2017). Another case of victim blaming to excuse or justify a police killing of a civilian.</p>
<p>Justice David Paciocco said in his decision: “Most significantly, the trial judge made irrelevant and adverse comments about Ms. Abogado’s conduct” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>Incredibly, according to Paciocco, O’Marra instructed the jury to consider that Abogado was jaywalking and described that as an “inherently risky activity” (despite the fact that people do it all the time without harm) and that “pedestrians must be aware, when they jaywalk, that drivers are not always paying attention, not always concentrating on what is going on ahead of them” (quoted in Beattie 2017). Even more O’Marra took a page out of the “what was she wearing” playbook for dismissing women victims of crime, and argued that Abogado’s clothing was dark and had “poor visibility” at the time of the collision (Beattie 2017). This was simply a replay, and reinforcement, of the Romano legal team’s defense ploy to get their client off.</p>
<p>The appeals decision noted that these statements turned the jury’s attention away from the central issue of whether or not Romano’s driving was itself, in fact, dangerous (Beattie 2017). By then the damage had been done to the Crown’s case. Concluded Paciocco: “The errors in the charge … are sufficiently serious that the jury was not in a position to evaluate properly the dangerousness of the operation of the motor vehicle, leading to a miscarriage of justice” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>At the second trial, Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter pointed out that Romano operated his vehicle at such a high rate of speed that it became impossible for him to adjust his driving in the event that something unexpected happened (Beattie 2017). Even more, his speeding was entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable according to the Crown. The surveillance operation that Romano was part of was only focused on intelligence-gathering and, as such, was neither dangerous nor urgent (Beattie 2017). It should never have resulted in the death of an innocent young woman.</p>
<p>York Regional police have confirmed that Detective-Constable Remo Romano is still an active officer on the force.</p>

       *<p>It is extremely rare in the Canadian state context for a police officer who kills a civilian to face charges. Even where charges are pursued in court killer cops are almost never found guilty by the system they uphold, protect, and service. The verdict in the case of York Regional Police officer Remo Romano who killed pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado (18) on the evening of February 12, 2014 while speeding offers yet another sad case in point. On September 2, 2016 a jury declared Romano not guilty of dangerous driving causing death. Their decision came after seven hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of Carla Abogado by Remo Romano</p>
<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano (44) was driving an unmarked pickup truck at an incredible speed of 115 km/h, nearly double the 60 km/h speed limit, when he struck Abogado, killing her. The young victim was thrown approximately 80 meters and was declared dead on the scene in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario. Notably, Constable Romano did not have his sirens or lights activated (Yuen 2016a). At the time he hit and killed Abogado, Romano was part of a surveillance team, Project Litterbox, investigating a series of non-violent commercial break-ins involving major Canadian capitalist enterprises such as Shopper’s Drug Mart, according to details provided to the jury (Hasham 2016). They were said to be stealing…perfume (Mandel 2016). Far from being a threat or crucial pursuit situation, Romano had simply fallen behind the other officers in his team and was speeding to catch up to them when he struck Abogado who had just gotten off a bus on her way home.</p>
<p>Crown prosecutor Perlmutter informed the jury that the surveillance operation Romano was involved in at the time he killed Abogado was only involved in intelligence gathering and was by no means dangerous nor urgent (Hasham 2016). Certainly it was not a matter of life and death urgency that he catch up with his team (or he might not have been so lax in falling behind in the first place). According to Perlmutter: “(He was) not entitled to drive at those speeds, to put himself in position where he did not have the time and space to respond to a jaywalker. This did not justify the risk to the public” (quoted in Hasham 2016). And we might stress again that this was an operation in which the police were providing essentially private security services for Canadian capital. Revealing once more that essential and unwavering connection.</p>
<p>The Crown’s collision reconstruction expert informed the court that a car going more than 80 km/h would likely have hit Abogado but at a slower speed, that car could have been able to stop or swerve to avoid impact instead. It was also noted that anyone jaywalking would have estimating oncoming vehicles traveling at the speed limit of 60 km/h (Hasham 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaming the Victim</p>
<p>Romano cynically blamed the victim on the stand stating: “She made the choice to step out in front of my vehicle” (quoted in Yuen 2016a). An incredibly callous and self-serving assertion.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Bill MacKenzie also blamed the victim for jaywalking rather than using a crosswalk. He cynically called the killing a “tragic accident” and went on to blame her clothing choice (quoted in Hasham 2016). Even more MacKenzie used the old ploy of tempting a jury to feel sorry for an officer who would be disgraced by being convicted. He further suggested that there is a disjuncture between the identity of officer and the identity of criminal as if the two are mutually exclusive. And he slyly suggested to the jury that they did not want to be responsible for effecting such an outcome for a supposed community servant. In his words: “At what speed does he go from being a police officer serving his community to a convicted criminal?” (quoted in Hasham 2016).</p>
<p>Constable Romano suffered panic attacks and was prescribed the anti-anxiety medication later found in his bag at the site of the crash (Mandel 2016). He claimed it was “just there for security” and insisted he had not taken any the night of the crash (Mandel 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Family Devastated</p>
<p>This decision comes in Romano’s second trial. At an earlier trial in May, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict following two days of deliberations (Hasham 2016). Abogado’s family, who sat through both trials left the courtroom without common following the September verdict.</p>
<p>Carla Abogado’s father, Guillermo Abogado, expresses only disappointment with the verdict that has left the family further devastated. He worries for what the decision will men for other victims’ families as well. In his words:</p>
<p>“My whole family was very upset, we were expecting a guilty verdict. From Day 1 until now, it’s very hard for us. The jury are allowing the police officers to use 115 km/h on a busy street, near a hospital and subway station. I hope they have a conscience because it may happen again now. They’ve set a precedent. They’re allowing every police officer to do it again.” (quoted in Yuen 2016b).</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction with the court system is echoed by Paula Abogado, Carla’s sixteen-year- old younger sister. From her perspective: “With this, we were trying to find a little bit of closure, but now what are we going to get out of this? Every time there’s a trial we always get a reminder and it just brings us back to this place where we have no time to heal” (quoted in Yuen 2016b). Sadly this is the disappointing outcome experienced by almost all families of victims of police violence in Canada who expect justice through the court system.</p>
<p>Guillermo Abogado noted the difficulties and frustrations that families face when the killer of their loved one is a police officer. As he reflects, painfully: “We’re fighting a police officer, they have lots of support. I felt it was scripted. He faced the jury and was crying to get the sympathy of the jury. Maybe they felt it worked last time, so they’ll do it again” (quoted in Yuen 2016b). History in such cases in the Canadian context shows they do.</p>
<p>The Abogado family is also pursuing a $2.2 million civil suit against the York Regional Police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The verdict while not shocking given the historic lack of accountability for police officers who kill civilians did seem to skirt all reason. As the Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter laid out, Romano ignored the obvious and foreseeable risks of driving at such speeds through a residential area with both a seniors’ center and bus stop en route (Hasham 2016). According to Perlmutter: “(Abogado) died on account of a fatal combination of Mr. Romano’s excessive speed and lack of attention” (quoted in Hasham 2016). In support of business interests. And once again a killer cop is let off the hook despite what logic dictates.</p>

On July 20, 2017 the coroner’s inquest into his killing by police was released and concluded incredibly that his death was accidental. Now for most reasonable people if a civilian pepper sprayed, beat, restrained, and stepped on someone and they died it would not be viewed as an accident. Death would be recognized as a probability outcome of those actions being inflicted on someone.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station, in the community 400 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, concerned about shortness of breath and looking for help. A nurse there viewed his behavior as erratic (one would think acting erratically is not atypical for someone in medical distress) and called Nishawbe-Aski police.</p>
<p>The two officers who arrived pepper sprayed Wesley, tackled him onto the floor, beat him with a baton, and handcuffed his hands behind him. With police forcing him face down on the floor and with their boots on his head, neck, and back, Wesley stopped breathing. The inquest determined this to be an accident but we might reasonable ask if he would have died in the absence of this police assault.</p>
<p>None of the medical staff at the nursing station, including the doctor and nurses, did anything to help Wesley, perhaps fearful of police response if they tried. They only checked on him after he stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest, in a manner not unique in cases of police killing civilians, decided to blame the victim in their ruling. They found the cause of Wesley’s death to be “struggle and restraint (chest compression, prone positioning, handcuffing) as well as agitation and trauma (pain)&#8230;.with acute alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.” Restraint, agitation, and trauma are all directly attributable to actions taken by the police officers. These were not accidents.</p>
<p>The jury made 53 recommendations. Some of them highlight systemic racism within government services in Indigenous communities (without actually naming racism). They include:</p>
<p>Cultural training courses for nurses before being placed in an Indigenous community.</p>
<p>Hiring medical staff and police officers who speak the language of the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Developing a protocol for police interventions in medical facilities within Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Designating Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services as a police force under the Police Services Act in Ontario and thus providing for some civilian oversight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By all accounts Romeo Wesley was a beloved member of the community and is missed by many. The community was hoping for much more from this inquiry.</p>

       ***<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates police harm to civilians in Ontario, is examining the death of a 50-year-old man who was held at a police station in Thunder Bay, Ontario, on July 19, 2017. According to the SIU, police and paramedics attended an address on Fort William Road around 8 PM the evening before. After being cleared medically by paramedics, the man was taken by police to the police station and placed in a cell. The SIU reports that a bit after midnight, the man was found in his cell not breathing. He was taken to hospital by paramedics and was pronounced dead there. Thunder Bay police have garnered much negative attention recently for concerns about widespread racism within the force in relation to treatment of Indigenous residents in the area.</p>
       <p>The Thunder Bay police have garnered much notoriety recently over concerns of widespread racism on the force against Indigenous people in the area. Now the 50-year-old man who died in his cell while in custody of Thunder Bay police has been identified as Marlon “Roland” Jerry McKay. He died on July 19, 2017, after being arrested and detained for as yet unstated reasons. The victim’s family has confirmed that McKay, of the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (KI) First Nation 600 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, was in the city for medical reasons. Paramedics supposedly cleared him on health grounds before he was taken by police. The family has apparently been told by the coroner that McKay did not die of a heart attack. The Special Investigations Unit is examining the case.</p>
       ***<p>Killer cops, their forces, and their police associations are regularly coming up with euphemisms and bogus “conditions” to excuse or legitimize their killings. The litany includes “excited delirium,” “suicide by cop,” and the mystical “sudden death.” The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians is investigating a case that police are calling “sudden death” in Chatham, Ontario on July 26, 2017.</p>
<p>Sometime on the night of July 25, Chatham-Kent police responded to a 911 call allegedly involving a domestic dispute. According to the SIU police remained outside the house on Greenfield Lane for quite some time.</p>
<p>Then the storyline jumps dramatically with no explanation. The SIU reports police entered the house at around 7:00 AM and—huge jump here—a 52-year old man, since identified as Shawn Davis, was pronounced dead at the scene (killed?, found dead?, etc.?). No one is saying. But sudden death does not cut it.</p>
<p>CKPS Constable Kelly Helbin said police would not release any other information. This only adds to the sense of police acting suspiciously in this case.</p>
       ***<p>The 2017 coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Michael MacIsaac has already heard dubious testimony from the officer who shot him, Brian Taylor. As the inquest continues, on July 26, another police officer, Durham Regional Police Constable Mark Brown, has added to the questionable police testimony by suggesting that the dying victim played a part in his own death by actively resisting help.  Brown was the first to respond to a 911 call involving Michael MacIsaac on that morning on December 2, 2013. MacIsaac was shot by Taylor while he was experiencing effects of an epileptic seizure and was naked in the street near his home.</p>
<p>In Brown&#8217;s own testimony: “I remember him saying stuff, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The only thing I understood when performing first aid, was MacIsaac said ‘pain’ (quoted in McLaughlin 2017). That seems clear enough. But the cop wants the jury to believe the dying man did not want the pain to stop.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family lawyer, Roy Wellington questioned Constable Brown about his claim that MacIsaac resisted help. Asked Wellington: “Does it strike you as odd that someone would not want to be touched after being shot by the same people” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)? Brown could not offer such empathetic insight.</p>
<p>Family members in attendance at the inquest were dumbfounded at the officer’s testimony. Said Brian MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne:  “I can’t imagine what was going through Michael’s head, and know the pain must have been horrible. But to tell him after the fact, we are here to help you? It’s ridiculous, ridiculous to me. Why didn&#8217;t you help him before?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017).  Joanne MacIsaac suggested that the officer’s testimony was not close to believable. She continued in frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“His narrative of what happened has got to be, in my opinion, fabricated. To say Michael was actively resisting when he’s naked, cold on the ground and you&#8217;re pushing in on his abdomen after he has been shot, to use the phrase ‘he’s actively resisting,’ my god what is the matter with these people?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under cross examination by Anita Szigeti, a lawyer with Toronto’s Empowerment Council for people with mental health issues, Constable Brown, an officer with 14 years of experience on the force had undertaken only one week of mental health training ever and that had occurred a decade before the killing of Michael MacIsaac. Brown had to admit on the stand that his training was not adequate.</p>

       ***<p>Romeo Wesley (34), of Cat Lake First Nation, died after being pepper sprayed, beaten, handcuffed, and stepped on by two police officers in his community’s nursing station in 2010. On July 20, 2017 the coroner’s inquest into his killing by police was released and concluded incredibly that his death was accidental. Now for most reasonable people if a civilian pepper sprayed, beat, restrained, and stepped on someone and they died it would not be viewed as an accident. Death would be recognized as a probability outcome of those actions being inflicted on someone.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station, in the community 400 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, concerned about shortness of breath and looking for help. A nurse there viewed his behavior as erratic (one would think acting erratically is not atypical for someone in medical distress) and called Nishawbe-Aski police.</p>
<p>The two officers who arrived pepper sprayed Wesley, tackled him onto the floor, beat him with a baton, and handcuffed his hands behind him. With police forcing him face down on the floor and with their boots on his head, neck, and back, Wesley stopped breathing. The inquest determined this to be an accident but we might reasonable ask if he would have died in the absence of this police assault.</p>
<p>None of the medical staff at the nursing station, including the doctor and nurses, did anything to help Wesley, perhaps fearful of police response if they tried. They only checked on him after he stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest, in a manner not unique in cases of police killing civilians, decided to blame the victim in their ruling. They found the cause of Wesley’s death to be “struggle and restraint (chest compression, prone positioning, handcuffing) as well as agitation and trauma (pain)&#8230;.with acute alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.” Restraint, agitation, and trauma are all directly attributable to actions taken by the police officers. These were not accidents.</p>
<p>The jury made 53 recommendations. Some of them highlight systemic racism within government services in Indigenous communities (without actually naming racism). They include:</p>
<p>Cultural training courses for nurses before being placed in an Indigenous community.</p>
<p>Hiring medical staff and police officers who speak the language of the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Developing a protocol for police interventions in medical facilities within Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Designating Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services as a police force under the Police Services Act in Ontario and thus providing for some civilian oversight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By all accounts Romeo Wesley was a beloved member of the community and is missed by many. The community was hoping for much more from this inquiry.</p>
       ***<p>Killer cop Brian Taylor provided two days of questionable, even outright unbelievable, testimony during the coroner’s inquest into his 2013 killing of 47-year-old Michael MacIsaac. As witnesses and 911 call evidence contradicted much of his depiction of events, Constable Taylor turned to the bogus and obnoxious “excited delirium” excuse to blame the victim. Notably the inquest testimony was the first time he raised this baseless suggestion, a last refuge of killer cops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contradicted Testimony</p>
<p>Taylor claims he feared for his life when seeing MacIsaac, yet he was safely inside his police vehicle and decided to exit only after seeing the man he was supposedly threatened by near him. Taylor claimed in his testimony that he heard MacIsaac say “Come on, come on,” and claims that he issued the police challenge, “Police. Don’t move,” to MacIsaac and remembers hearing it.</p>
<p>Taykor testified at length:</p>
<p>“Somebody said ‘Drop it, get down on the ground.’ I thought that if I have to take a shot, don’t miss. There are a lot of people around. Then he moved off the curb. I fired the first round. I didn’t hear the gun go off. I felt it . . . . I didn’t know if I had hit him, because there was no effect. And he continued to move and I fired a second round and I know that one struck him.” (quoted in Gallant 2017a)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wellington, the MacIsaac family’s lawyer, used cross-examination to note that most of Constable Taylor’s claims about what was said are not captured on a 911 call made by Ron Nino the witness who stopped the arriving Taylor and told him MacIsaac was in the area. On that call a voice is heard telling Nino “get back, get back” (Gallant 2017a). Only seconds later shots are fired. No one is heard at any point either issuing commands to MacIsaac or saying “Come on, come on.” Nino said that Taylor fired almost immediately. The MacIsaac family had that call analyzed by a forensic scientist to see if there were cuts or absences. That report concluded that “there are no definite signs of alterations or breaks found on this recording” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>Queried Wellington: “I’m having a hard time understanding how we can hear someone further away from Mr. Nino, but we don’t actually hear you issuing any commands at all” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Wellington continued: ““Regardless of who shouted commands, there wasn’t much of an opportunity for Mr. MacIsaac to respond. Would you agree with that?” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Constable Taylor offered the rather desperate response that perhaps the cell phone malfunctioned. This despite the forensic tests. Taylor’s lawyer, Bill MacKenzie tried to suggest that 911 called Nino back and thus interfered with the call, which, frankly, makes no sense.</p>
<p>Questions are also being asked why Taylor shot MacIsaac twice and how he could not see if the first shot hit the man, since he was naked and there were no clothes to obscure a bullet strike and wound. Incredibly, Taylor believed the victim was “still a threat” even after he saw black-red blood streaming out of the stricken man’s abdomen. Two other officers took time to handcuff the dying man rather than giving him any medical attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constable Taylor Proposes Phoney “Excited Delirium”</p>
<p>Taylor, desperately and pathetically, tried to introduce the phony notion of “excited delirium” to describe MacIsaac and justify the killing. Excited delirium is a bogus claim produced by police and police associations after the fact when they kill someone. Incredibly Taylor suggested this was his first thought when hearing over police that the person he was seeking might be suffering mental health issues. The family suggests that MacIsaac was in crisis as a result of an epileptic seizure but did not have mental health issues.</p>
<p>Anita Szigeti, a lawyer for the Empowerment Council, an advocacy group for people with lived experiences of mental health and addiction issues noted that organizations including the World Health Organization and American Medical Association do not recognize it as an actual condition (Gallant 2017b). Szigeti rightly pointed out that the only ones who maintain that it is a condition are the “maker of Tasers” and law enforcement members (Gallant 2017b). We might add pro-police criminologists or copagandists.</p>
<p>Szigeti posed this to Constable Taylor. In her words: “But, do you know ‘excited delirium’ is extremely controversial, over whether it’s even a condition at all?” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). Taylor answered simply, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Szigeti said that she was puzzled because Taylor promoted the notion of excited delirium at the inquest but the term does not appear anywhere in his notes on the shooting. Neither does it appear in his interviews with the Special Investigations Unit or the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>This led Szigeti to conclude: “I’m going to suggest to you that you never thought about ‘excited delirium’ at all until long after the events when you shot Mr. MacIsaac” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). This at base the nature of this phony claim. It is an after the fact justification for killer cops desperate for an answer when all reasonable explanations are absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Joanne MacIsaac, Michael MacIsaac’s sister, is also asking if the SIU bothered to listen to the Nino 911 call in its investigation into the killing which resulted in a decision not to bring criminal charges against Constable Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor ended his testimony, on its second day, with the admission, in response to a question from a juror: “With hindsight being 20/20, yes, there probably could have been a better way to resolve it” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>

       ***<p>Constable Brian Taylor (46), the Durham police officer who shot and killed Michael MacIsaac took the stand July 20, 2017 for his first day of testimony at the coroner’s inquest into the killing. Taylor shot and killed MacIsaac, who was clearly in distress, on December 2, 2013 in Ajax, Ontario. The officer’s testimony raised many serious questions about his actions and aspects of his account have been contradicted by witnesses who have already testified.</p>
<p>Constable Taylor shot Michael MacIsaac within seconds of encountering the distressed man who was in the street naked. Taylor claims that MacIsaac came at him with a table leg and that he feared for his life. Yet witnesses have testified that MacIsaac was not holding any table leg at the time he was shot. A patio table leg allegedly retrieved at the scene was lightweight and hollow.  Taylor testified that it was obvious to him that MacIsaac was in distress as soon as he saw the man. Yet he did nothing to de-escalate the situation. This despite the fact that two other police officers were already at the scene. No warning was issued to MacIsaac by any officer before the shooting.</p>
<p>Serious questions remain about why Constable Taylor fired a second shot at the already stricken man. It is also uncertain why Taylor exited his police car to confront the man if he feared for his life. He would have been entirely safe against the naked man from within his police vehicle. These issues raise troubling questions about the actions taken by Constable Taylor</p>

Now the 50-year-old man who died in his cell while in custody of Thunder Bay police has been identified as Marlon “Roland” Jerry McKay.

Police in the small northern Ontario city shot and killed Joey Knapaysweet, 21, on Saturday, February 3, 2018. Then, on Sunday, February 4, Agnes Sutherland, 62, died in police custody. Both victims were from Fort Albany First Nation, a James Bay community.</p>
<p>Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents nearly 50 Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, expressed great concern over the two deaths in two days. In his words: “It’s very troubling. The families have a lot of questions” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deaths at the Hands of Police</p>
<p>Details about both deaths are limited so far. Police control information about their killings and deaths related to their activities. This is a problem across Canada in terms of policing. Police did not release the names of their victims. The names were conformed by multiple other sources, including federal Member of Parliament Charlie Angus.</p>
<p>With regard to the police shooting of Joey Knapaysweet, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has only said that  there was “an interaction” between officers and the victim and an officer discharged a firearm striking the man.</p>
<p>Agnes Sutherland was arrested at a shelter after having been asked to leave the Timmins District Hospital, where she had sought help. She was taken to a police station and put in a cell on Saturday, the same day Knapaysweet was killed. Later that same evening she was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead late Sunday.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by Indigenous leaders Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Jonathan Solomon of the Mushkegowuk Council, and Fort Albany First Nation Chief Andrew Solomon, serious questions are raised: “It is alleged that when police attended at the scene of the local shelter, Ms. Sutherland was treated roughly while being taken into police custody. She suffered severe complications during her detention” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemic Racism and Colonial Legacies</p>
<p>In their statement, Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Solomon and Chief Andrew Solomon call for a timely and thorough investigation. They raise the very real issues of racism in policing and the violence targeted at Indigenous people by police. In their words: “We have seen systemic racism in the city of Thunder Bay, and must now wonder if this is also happening in Timmins” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>Notably, Timmins Mayor Steve Black acknowledged that the deaths at the hands of police had increased racial tensions in the city, though he did not specify. He said: “I don’t believe there’s room for racism in any community. If changes need to be made or things need to be done to improve those relationships, we’re definitely willing to work with our partners on improving those relationships” (quoted in Perkel 2018). No word on whether that includes dismantling settler colonial police forces (or mayoralties). He has, though, condemned people who have spoken out against the police and their actions on social media (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Health Care Not Cops</p>
<p>According to the Chiefs, both victims had left the remote community of Fort Albany, near Ontario’s James Bay coast, to seek medical care in Timmins. They note in their statement: “Our people must continually leave their families and communities to come to cities to seek services that are not available in their respective communities” (quoted in 2018). The deaths come as an emergency summit is being held in Timmins by the Mushkegowuk Council this week. The regional James Bay government declared a state of emergency in November, concerned over the growing number of drugs and alcohol coming into its seven member communities (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Sutherland’s son, Glen Sutherland, told the <em>Timmins Daily Press</em> that his mother was a survivor of the notorious St. Anne’s residential school. He said that she needed a wheelchair to get around, and questioned the actions of hospital staff. She was using a wheelchair at the time of her arrest. Glen Sutherland said that her frequent trips to the emergency room were a cry for help (Perkel 2018). She was a mother of six with six great grandchildren.</p>
<p>The mistreatment at hospitals of Indigenous people seeking medical assistance has been a disturbing, and too common, issue in various locations in Canada, including infamous cases in Winnipeg, Manitoba that have gained some national attention. It speaks to ongoing legacies of colonialism and racism in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A vigil in Timmins for Knapaysweet on Tuesday, February 6, drew around 100 people. Chief Andrew Solomon is calling on the Attorney General of Ontario and the Minister of Community Safety to investigate the Timmins Police (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Police and criminal justice systems more broadly in Canada disproportionately target Indigenous people and disproportionately target them for violence. Criminal justice systems, including police forces, were founded as instruments of settler colonialism, occupation, dispossession, and displacement and this must always be front and center in discussions of policing in the country.</p>

       ***<p>It has been a deadly weekend at the hands of police in Timmins, Ontario. A 62-year-old woman died in custody of the Timmins Police Service on February 4, 2018.

This is a force in a small city in northeastern Ontario.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) reports that officers with the Timmins Police Service were called to the Timmins hospital to investigate a woman, for undisclosed reasons. The woman was apparently asked to leave, but a short time later was allegedly causing an unspecified “disturbance” at a shelter in the area of Ross Avenue East and Hemlock Street in the city According to the SIU, officers arrested the woman then took her to the police station and placed her in a cell.</p>

<p>The police accounts of the death have not been independently confirmed publicly. Police have not released the name of the woman.</p>
       ***<p>Few details have been released publicly after a 21-year-old man was shot and killed by police in Timmins, Ontario, sometime around the early morning of February 3, 2018. It has been announced that a post-mortem examination on the victim’s body was scheduled for February 5. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has only said that officers of the Timmins Police Service were deployed to an emergency medical services building to “deal with a man” in some unspecified way for some unspecified reason. They say that at some point their was an “interaction” (again unspecified) in which an officer fired a gun, striking and killing the man.  The SIU reports that it has assigned three investigators and three forensic investigators to the case. It has identified one “subject officer” and seven “witness officers.” Results of the post-mortem have not been released at this point.</p>

1994-09-29,566_CRAP,1994-09-29,,,ON,Toronto,,Unspecified,,Albert,,Moses,,41.0,,,,,,Persons who died IN police custody,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>The family of influential artist Moses Amik Beaver is demanding answers after their loved one was found dead in his cell at the Thunder Bay Jail on Monday, February 13, 2017. The 59-year-old Beaver struggled with mental health issues and those close to him want to know why he was being held in jail and not a health care facility. Jails in Canada are too often used by the state as holding centers for Indigenous people in need of health care not punishment, even well after health care issues have been identified.</p>
<p>Local Indigenous leaders, including Johnny Yellowhead, chief of the Nibinamik (Summer Beaver) band in northwestern Ontario, where Moses Beaver’s family lived has called for a full public examination into Beaver’s death and what might have been done to help him. He could not say why Beaver was in custody but reported that he had expressed concern about depression and blackouts.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement released Thursday, February 16, 2017, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski First Nation said:</p>
<p>“The sudden and unexplained death of Moses Beaver was devastating to his family and everyone in Nibinamik. For Moses to die under these circumstances is troubling on so many levels, especially as his death has not been officially acknowledged by those responsible for his care. We are doing everything possible to support Chief and Council and the family of Moses Beaver, and we will demand an investigation into the circumstances around his passing.” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Said Chief Yellowhead: “Our dear friend Moses Beaver had struggled for many years with mental health issues but we do not understand why he was in custody or the circumstances that led to his death. It is clear that Moses needed professional help and a psychiatric assessment, and we demand to know why this didn’t happen” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay art gallery owner JP Fraser remembers the artists whose work his gallery has featured: “He was a very gentle person. He was a very warm, welcoming, outgoing and caring man. His painting skills will be a great loss to the artistic community. And what a waste of a life. He should have had treatment” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Fraser identified the Thunder Bay Jail as the wrong place to hold someone with mental illness (a fact clear to many except police it seems). In his view: “It is just not a place for someone with mental-health issues” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a). One issue that emerges in city after city in Canada is that mental health services and funding are insufficient while police budgets continue to increase even as crime rates drop.</p>
<p>This point is emphasized by Johnny Yellowhead: “I wish there was better health care. He wanted to get better. He asked me to help” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay Police and jail officials have refused to comment on either why Beaver was being held in custody or on the circumstances of his death. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services confirmed that there was a death in the jail on Monday but would not say more.</p>
<p>The Thunder Bay Jail is already quite notorious in the Canadian context. It is the very facility where Indigenous youth Adam Capay (23) was held in solitary confinement for more than four years before public pressure pushed provincial authorities to change his conditions.</p>
<p>Moses Amik Beaver painted in the vivid Woodlands style associated with Ojibwe artist Norval Morrisseau. He was well known for his depictions of spirits and animals, painted in vivid colors and outlined in black. He was also very much appreciated for his work with children in local schools.</p>

Less than a day before more than ten Toronto Police officers, including a tactical squad equipped with a battering ram and shields, had forced their way into the Gonzalez home where the 43 year old occupant had apparently locked himself in his bathroom for reasons yet unknown. During the police encounter two Tasers were deployed against Gonzalez and he was taken from the building on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Photographs taken by Gonzalez’s wife at the hospital reveal horrific injuries including a bloody head injury, a black eye, bruising on an arm and shoulder, and what the family believes to be a Taser mark near the victim’s groin. The family was notified that Gonzalez had internal bleeding shortly before he succumbed to his injuries. His mother and wife reported than he had no injuries before police arrived. They also reported being kept from entering the apartment by police officers.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, despite the injuries sustained by the victim in his encounter with police and despite his death in hospital the next day, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), tasked with investigating all such incidents of police involved civilian harm, took five days before showing up at the apartment to investigate. The family was not told to preserve the scene in the bathroom where the encounter is believed to have occurred and it is not clear if essential evidence has been lost as a result. SIU should have attended and secured the scene directly once it was reported.</p>
<p>Toronto police have refused to comment on the case but an SIU spokesperson confirmed that police reported the incident the day it happened and notified the SIU when Gonzalez died the next day. No answer has been given by SIU for why it took their investigators four days to contact the family. Three SIU investigators and one forensic investigator have since been assigned to the case.</p>

<p>Anthony Aust, a 23-year-old Black man, fell to his death from a twelfth-floor apartment after Ottawa police used a so-called dynamic entry, a tactic identified by courts as showing disregard for Charter rights. Police used the dynamic entry while executing a drug raid, according to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians, in the morning of October 7, 2020.</p>



<p>It has not been reported publicly what happened after police entered the apartment, what police did, or how long they were there before the victim fell. It has been reported that other people were present inside the apartment at the time of the raid, including younger siblings, mother, grandmother, and stepfather, but not whether they sustained any injuries.</p>



<p>Dynamic entries are akin to the infamous “no knock” raids familiar  in the United States. Masked officers break into a building, often deploying “distraction devices,” such as flash grenades, with guns drawn. While legally required to knock and announce their presence as police, this is not always done (Yogaretnam 2020)</p>



<p>On February 11, 2020, Superior Court Justice Sally Gomery ruled, with reference to another drug raid case, that police use of dynamic entry is “serious misconduct” (Yogaretnam 2020). In her decision she concluded:</p>



<p>“The knock-and-announce principle has been part of Canadian law for decades. The officers who testified did not say when the Ottawa police decided that dynamic entry should be the rule rather than the exception. However long the practice has been in place, it reflects a casual disregard for charter rights.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 2020)</p>



<p>She denied blanket justifications for the use of dynamic entry based on police claims of “officer safety.” In her words:</p>



<p>“This does not justify systemic use of dynamic entry to execute all, or almost all, search warrants of private dwellings in Ottawa. The police cannot operate from an assumption that they should break in the door of any residence that they have a warrant to search. The court must be concerned about disassociating itself from this practice.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 20200</p>



<p>Police have since said that regardless of this finding they will continue to use the practices and clearly have done so.</p>



<p>While few details related to the death have been released publicly, this seems to be another fatality in the statist war on drugs. Decriminalization is essential, not still more police violence.</p>



<p>Three investigators and one forensic investigator have been assigned to the case by the SIU.</p>

       ***<p>On September 4, 1995, several members of the Stony Point nation entered Ipperwash Provincial Park, located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron in the area called, in statist terms, southwestern Ontario, with the intention of reclaiming their community’s land and a traditional burial ground. Within 72 hours of the indigenous community occupation at Ipperwash Provincial Park, one of the community’s members, Anthony O’Brien (Dudley) George was dead. He had been shot and killed by an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Kenneth “Tex” Deane, who had fired multiple rounds from an assault weapon at the non-threatening and unarmed George.</p>
<p>After the shooting of Dudley George many questions began to be asked. What role did the Ontario government play in pushing the OPP to move on the occupiers? Why did the OPP decide to march on the occupiers, taking an aggressive and confrontational approach (a full frontal assault) when there were already plans developed to address the situation through less aggressive means? Why were the OPP armed so heavily and with assault with assault weapons when it was known through a CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Services) mole that the occupiers were unarmed?</p>
<p>Some partial answers to these questions would only come out in the criminal trial of Tex Deane and the public inquiry held a decade after George’s homicide by police. The shooting of Dudley George came a day after newly elected Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris ordered OPP to “get the fucking Indians out of Ipperwash Park” (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). An aide in the Premier’s office notoriously proclaimed: “The government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians.” This was only a day before Dudley George was shot and killed. Yet the deeper answers to these questions are rooted in the general history of colonialism and genocide in Canada and the specific harms inflicted on The Kettle Point and Stony Point communities.</p>
<p>At the heart of policing across the Canadian context is, as it always is in the case of settler colonialism, control of land, Indigenous land. In the Canadian state context policing has always been a military exercise in the service of displacement, dispossession, seizure, securing, and settling of land and, where deemed necessary, re-seizing and re-securing land in those cases where Indigenous communities have organized to reclaim their community lands. The examples in Canadian history are numerous and ongoing. A litany of state organized and state enacted theft. Nothing less. Organized crime at the highest level. The names of incidents of state violence in the seizure of Indigenous lands live in infamy. So too the cases of police assaults carried out in the re-taking of land re-claimed by Indigenous communities. Oka, Gustafsen Lake, Sun Peaks, Caledonia, to name only a few recent ones. And Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Ongoing History of Colonial Crimes: Always an Ipperwash Crisis for Indigenous People</p>
<p>The great Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, whose relations moved to Kettle Point, received a lecture from his older brother Chiksika. He said:</p>
<p>“When a white man kills an Indian in a fair fight it is called honorable, but when an Indian kills a white man in a fair fight it is called murder&#8230; When an Indian is killed it is a great loss which leaves a gap in our people and a sorrow in our heart; when a white is killed, three or four others step up to take his place and there is no end to it. The white man seeks to conquer nature, to bend it to his will and use it wastefully&#8230;The whole white race is a monster who is always hungry and what he eats is land.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 33)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of the OPP Ipperwash police assault and the killing of Dudley George is rooted in a historic theft of land by the Canadian government for purposes of war. On July 10, 1827, Chief Wawanosh would conclude a treaty that would see King George IV acquire around 2,200,000 acres of prime land in Southwestern Ontario. The treaty would see the establishment of the Kettle and Stony Point reserves with a measly 5000 acres combined. The treaty conference that gave rise to the Kettle and Stony Point reserves came from a concern over land squatting (theft) by white settlers. In return the Indigenous communities received a promise that the Crown would provide living payments “annually and forever” (Edwards 2001, 39). Yet the Crown came to this agreement clearly intending that forever would be a very short time, if the Indigenous population decreased and, indeed, disappeared. The genocidal intentions, or at least expectations, of government, settlers, and missionaries were not hidden beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Primitive accumulation in the Canadian context occurred according to a brutal explicit calculus. This was made clear in crude terms by Reverend Thomas Hurlburt, Methodist missionary to Kettle and Stony Point and the city of Sarnia. In 1864 Reverend Hurlburt wrote in a piece in the <em>Lambton County Gazeteer and Genneral Business Directory</em> to lay out the mathematics of genocide for the general public. He stated:</p>
<p>“This is the easiest and cheapest way to dispose of the Indians of North America; for they must be disposed of in one of three ways; killed in war or by drink or Christianized by missionaries and thus made useful members of society&#8230;</p>
<p>“Having been in the mission among the Indians for the past 35 years, and having lived and labored among them in that capacity, I am acquainted with most of the tribes from Texas to the Hudson’s Bay territory, as well as in Canada, I have taken pains to gather the statistics of various Indian wars—the Florida, Black Hawks and others, and I find it requires $25,000 to dispose of an Indian by war, in addition to one white man being killed for every Indian. To dispose of them by drink I found by the statistics of those tribes who had large annuities, and consequently drunk much, that it required about $2,000 to kill an Indian by whiskey&#8230;</p>
<p>“In taking the statistics of our own Indian missions, I find it requires about $200 to Cristianize and civilize an Indian, and train him twenty years and thus give him a chance for both his life and that which is to come. Thus it is seen that it requires as much to kill an Indian in war as would Christianize 125, and train them twenty years. It requires as much to kill an Indian by whiskey as would Christianize and save ten. There are 125,000 Indians in British North America.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 41)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the market calculus, the marketization of genocide. It is the logic that would give rise to the horrors of the residential schools and cultural erasure. This is the ongoing logic of colonialism that would find expression, sometimes explicit, in the Ipperwash crisis. It has economic, political, and cultural aspects.</p>
<p>A letter sent by agent A. Dingman of Strathroy to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald on August 27, 1884 and marked “Confidential” told a story of systematic theft of the resources of the reserve lands. In the letter Dingman recorded the activities of a timber mill owner A.L. Smith who operated in the area. The mill had been set up by the capitalist to ensure cloaked thievery. Noting that white settlers had stripped non-reserve lands of resources, Dingman reports:</p>
<p>“and there is now absolutely no place from which it is practicable to get logs with which to stock the mill except they come off the Indian Reserves. It is situated in such an out-of-the-way place that any person so disposed could easily get logs off the Reserves and few people would be aware of the fact unless they were specially interested in finding it out&#8230;.If the object was to plunder the Reserves of timber no better place could be found than the spot where the mill is situated.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As was common across the area of Ontario, the capitalist represented himself as an agent of the government. Smith had even constructed a phony title for himself, “forest bailiff,” a position that did not actually exist in Ontario. In a scheme that brought together the recent push to Christianize the communities the capitalist concocted a deal to return some sawed boards to the community for sue in building a church the newly converted now wanted. As Dingman reported: “never a board was used on the church. This process was repeated time and time again until fully $5,000 worth of timber was cut and sawed into timber, but not one board went towards building the church” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42). Still the cutting for profit brought the woods to the point of being barren of trees.</p>
<p>Dingman suggested that the trees at Stony Point might not survive another winter of plunder (Edwards 2001, 42). While settlers for miles around had fences for their farms, the Native farmers had no wood for their own fences (Edwards 2001, 43).</p>
<p>There were no charges brought by the Government of Canada against any of the settlers or capitalists who had stolen from the Indigenous communities. Nor was anyone held responsible for government corruption or incompetence (Edwards 2001, 43). The government of Prime Minister Macdonald protected capitalist interests in Treaty 242 of 1888 which gave the federal government permission to sell Native timber rights in exchange for minimal cooperation. Notably the failure of the government to meet wartime promises to provide compensation for wartime service in the War of 1812 persisted throughout the community. Similar struggles would play out over service in subsequent wars up through the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1927 a group of land speculators with connections in Ottawa turned their greedy eyes to reserve lands on the shores of Lake Huron. Band members were offered bribes of five dollars if they voted to surrender the lands to developers. An additional ten dollars was offered if the vote to surrender the lands was approved by council (Edwards 2001, 45). Despite the fact that the lands were located at Kettle Point, the vote (and the bribes) were offered to men of both bands. In the end the 33 acres of parkland were purchased by speculators for eighty-five dollars per acre. Half was resold immediately by the developers who had a pre-existing deal for three hundred dollars and acre. The Kettle Point band received $7706.20 for land that developers received $13,200 in selling only half.</p>
<p>Years later the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the federal government had cheated the community as government Indian agents abandoned the duty to protect by looking away as the deal went down. By that point cottagers had held the land for generations (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>In 1936 the Stoney Point community were deprived of more of their land, when the Province of Ontario purchased 108 acres of land that had been sold the previous year to private actors (Edwards 2001, 46). The land would be used for none other than Ipperwash Provincial Park.</p>
<p>When workers preparing the park uncovered evidence of a Native burial ground appeals were made to government by band council to fence that area off from development. Despite official letters from provincial and federal governments approving of this request the fence was never built. The area would become a picnic grounds complete with horseshoe pits (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>The history of land theft by capital, settlers, and government against the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities would continue as war loomed in Europe in the late 1930s. The Canadian government desired a military training ground in Ontario (centrally located in the province with the country’s largest population). Businesses desired a facility in the area sine they could profit greatly servicing and supplying the base. Local businesses saw dollar signs in providing the base with fruit, vegetables, grains, bread, oil, canned goods, garbage removal, etc. as had been the  case with a base at Pinehill Camp (Edwards 2001, 46-47). That base was closed due to lack of running water on site, a great loss for profit seeking local capital. Stoney Point provided an ideal site right on the shores of Lake Huron and with water running all through it (Edwards 2001, 47).</p>
<p>In addition to its beneficial geographical qualities, Stoney Point offered a political benefit in that the Natives of Stoney Point did not have the vote and could not punish the government or local representatives at the voting booth. Another benefit for the government was financial. The Department of National Defence appraised the Stoney Point lands in 1942 at fifteen dollars per acre, which was much less than market value for nearby non-reserve lands. Economically, Native lands were viewed as “non-productive” (as long as Natives held them) despite the fact that they were directly farmed for food and essential for community purposes. The notion that Indigenous held lands were non-productive is one that returned to the center of federal government ideology under the Conservative Party regime of Stephen Harper in the 2000s as his government sought to convert Indigenous lands to marketable properties.</p>
<p>While the land deal would be put to a vote of the Stoney Point community a letter from the Secretary of Indian Affairs was sent to the local Indian agent stating that the government was “prepared to use the War Measures Act if the  Indians refused a surrender” (Edwards 2001, 47). Some vote then. Some democracy. Appropriately, on April Fools’ Day 1942 the Stoney Point band voted on the  fate of the lands. Members fighting overseas would not even get a vote. Under the government plan they would turn over the full 2211 acres of their land, all houses, and farms for a sum of $50,000.</p>
<p>Indigenous community members suggested a counter-proposal to lease the land to the federal government for the duration of the war but Ottawa rejected this. And why not? They had an ace up their sleeve. The vote showed a rejection of the government plan with the proposal being defeated 59-13 (Edwards 2001, 48). Never mind the “democratic” result. The government turned to their back up plan. On April 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order-in-council effecting an appropriation of the <em>entire</em> Stoney Point reserve.</p>
<p>Despite concerns among the federal Department of Justice about the legality of taking lands against the stated will of the community, the War Measures Act took the houses and land of the people of Stoney Point in the same manner as would also be imposed on supposed “enemy aliens” such as Japanese civilians (Edwards 2001, 48). Eighteen Stoney Point families were removed from their homes and lands and transferred to the Kettle Point reserve. They were merged into one band and reduced to one federally recognized chief. The Department of Indian Affairs which was supposed to look out for the interests of Indigenous communities (but rarely if ever did) raised not an eyebrow. In fact they viewed the move as a punitive measure to better oversee and regulate the people once they were in a closer space. One Indian agent even reported the dispossession and displacement as a great opportunity to round up a “few straggling Indians” (Edwards 2001, 49). To add insult to injury the government changed the name of the band from Stoney Point to Stony Point for unclear, bureaucratic, reasons. Their former land became Canadian Forces Base at Ipperwash (CFB Ipperwash).</p>
<p>Notably such a move for land expropriation would never have been considered against local white farmers or business property owners. Yet the area around the Stoney Point lands were being developed for less than essential purposes such as tourist resorts and weekend getaways for white visitors from the cities and from the United States. Those lands could have been appropriated with less impact on an existing community. The racist perspective of colonialism would not allow for consideration of such a move.</p>
<p>Residents of Stoney Point were moved without notification or even time to pack. As one displaced member Pearl George related: “When we came home, our house was up on jacks and our two log cabins were gone. They didn’t tell us anything&#8230;They never even let u know they were coming so we could pack up the little things. A lot of things were broken. They moved us to Kettle Point, to a swamp” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 49). Three of her children born at Kettle Point would die after developing intestinal problems that she attributed to the swamp[ water. The displaced felt like strangers in another land. As Maynard George, a son of Pearl, would state: It was sort of like in Bosnia where they put two different ethnic groups together. They did not allocate us good wood or housing. We could not become members of the band council or get any work on the reserve” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 50). This made no difference to government and likely never even registered at all. Other homes were simply levelled rather than moved. This was the fate suffered by the small church at Stoney Point as well as by many of the headstones in a nearby cemetery.</p>
<p>One can try to imagine the feelings of soldiers such as Clifford George who returned to a levelled land after having risked his life fighting in Europe (for the very state that was stealing and bulldozing his home while he faced enemy fire). He would  later reflect: “I came home to nothing. I’ll never forget the feeling I had when I first went there [to Stoney Point] and couldn’t find my mother’s grave. They had removed the headstones and there were bullet holes and trenches dug. They could only do that to an Indian. That would never happen to white people” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 52). With no home to return to George would move to a nearby town. He would be stripped of his legal Indian status. In his words: “I came back to find the real enemy was here” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 53).</p>
<p>The Canadian government had promised the Stony Point community that their lands would be returned to them at cessation of the fighting at war’s end. Following the end of World War Two the Transitional Powers Act replaced the War Measures Act setting the stage for a social transition to post-war conditions.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1946, the advanced infantry training center at CFB Ipperwash was closed. The Department of National Affairs and Department of Indian Affairs opened discussions about returning the confiscated lands to the Indigenous community. On December 31, 1946, the Transitional Powers Act expired and the stolen lands had still not been returned. Yet no extension was granted for the Department of National Defense to retain the Stony Point lands. The government had no legal basis to keep the lands. But it did.</p>
<p>In this context life went on. And grew. Dudley George was born on March 17, 1957 at Sarnia General Hospital. Anthony O’Brien George was the eighth of ten children in a family that lived at the Sarnia reserve after his family’s community was destroyed by the Canadian government 15 years before Dudley was born. Ironically he got his nickname Dudley after the character Dudley Do-Right a clueless Mountie featured in Saturday morning cartoons (Edwards 2001, 55). His family would move to Kettle Point when he was eight.</p>
<p>The efforts by Stony Point members to reclaim their land did not cease at any point during the period in which their lands were controlled by the Canadian government. Future Prime Minister Jean Chretien, then Minister of Indian Affairs noted in a letter to the Minister of National Defense in 1972:</p>
<p>“Since 1946 our respective Departments have been corresponding on the subject of the return of some 2,200 acres comprising Canadian Forces Base Camp Ipperwash which was appropriated in 1942 by the Department of National Defence under the War Measures Act&#8230;.</p>
<p>“The Chippewas of Kettle Point have repeatedly requested the return of these lands which are needed to enable the Band to improve its economic and social position. Time has not altered the Indians’ view that they were wronged by the forcible taking of their reserve in 1942. Moreover, it was their understanding that the land was to have been returned to them at the end of hostilities.</p>
<p>“With cuts in the Canadian Forces Bases indicated it seems to me that this is an appropriate time to reconsider this matter and I would appreciate having advice as to your Department’s plans for Camp Ipperwash. The transfer of this land to the administration and control of this Department so that it could be returned to reserve status would be of great importance to the Kettle Point Indians and would remove a major source of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Federal Government have dealt with this reserve.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 58)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing came of this of course. Of note, Chretien had become Prime Minister of Canada at the time the Ipperwash reclamation occupation, and shooting of Dudley George, occurred. Yet he did nothing as Prime Minister to improve a situation of injustice that he was clearly aware needed to be redressed and had be aware of for decades.</p>
<p>In 1950 the park superintendent’s wife had reported the discovery of human bones. By 1972 the government seemed to have forgotten about all discussions around fencing off the burial ground or about the discovery of bones.</p>
<p>The Canadian government made a payment of 2.5 million dollars to the Kettle and Stony Point band in 1980 as partial compensation for the base lands. This was accompanied by a promise that the lands would be returned when military use had finally ceased (Edwards 2001, 60). In March 1992 a report was tabled by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal People recommending that the federal government return the Camp Ipperwash lands to the Stony Point community.</p>
<p>The people themselves followed this recommendation up a month later when a gathering of 100 showed up at Camp Ipperwash to serve an eviction notice on the Department of National Defense. The government was given 20 days to leave the premises (Edwards 2001, 61). The group of 100 included members of the National Association of Japanese Canadians. Their representative Van Hori noted that his community had also lost their homes and had their land expropriated by the government during World War Two. He stated: “It took us forty-six years to get an apology and some kind of compensation&#8230;These people are still waiting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 61). The Department of National Defense replied in August 1992 that there was still a need to keep the Camp Ipperwash lands.</p>
<p>For many in the community the time for waiting was over. Fifty years had passed since the government stole the lands. Forty-six years since the promised time of return. On May 27, 1993 the military base was reoccupied by an Indigenous group calling itself now the Stoney Point First Nation. They named the reclaimed lands Aushoodaana Anjibaajrg meaning “resting place.” Dudley George was among that original group of land reclaimers.</p>
<p>The occupiers built homes on the base, pitched tents, parked trailers. The soldiers at the base remained doing what exercises they could. The occupation grew to around 100 residents with dozens more visiting regularly and offering support. Indigenous groups from across Turtle Island sent visitors. The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) offered solidarity in the form of timber for buildings and generators for power (Edwards 2001, 62). The happiness in the community was real. As Clifford George stated: “This is the first time in fifty years, since before the war, that we’ve all been together so close. We’re finally back together again, and that’s why we have such a good relationship&#8230;.I’m back to stay. They’ll have to carry me off and they better lock me up because the minute they let me loose, I’ll come back again” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 62). The community elected its own chief and council (outside the formal structures of the colonial Indian Act). This was an assertion of self-determination and self-governance. Traditional teachings were practiced. A peace tree was planted over a traditional stone axe. A month in the first permanent structure, a church, was completed (Edwards 2001, 63).</p>
<p>The military kept up low level Bell 212 helicopter flights for reconnaissance shining lights into the occupation camp. According to Clifford George: “Sometimes they flew so low they raised dust. They scare the kids and old people. I’m all in favour of laying of charges of harassment against the military” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 64). The helicopter crews that harassed the Stoney Point people had flown missions in the colonial deployment in Somalia.</p>
<p>The media war was also initiated against the Indigenous occupiers. Media began to portray them as terrorists not as a cheated community striving after decades to get their stolen lands back. In this the media were replaying by now well rehearsed narratives of Indigenous resistance as terrorism or criminality. Such discourses had only recently been trotted out and repeated for national and even international audiences during the Oka crisis of 1990.</p>
<p>In the federal budget speech of 1994 the government announced plans to negotiate the return of Camp Ipperwash lands. No date was given.</p>
<p>Enough was finally more than enough. On July 29, 1995, Stoney Point occupiers drove a yellow school bus through the doors of a base hall and refused to leave. The military simply withdrew. By the end of summer community members had secured contracts to maintain the base at ten dollars per hour. There was no violence.</p>
<p>On Monday, September 4, Labor Day, 1995, the Indigenous protesters occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park, as they had, in fact, promised to do. There were about 35 occupiers in the park on the first evening. Police knew from the start that this occupation differed from other recent occupations such as Oka in Quebec and Gustafsen Lake in British Columbia. Their own briefing notes reported “no visible weapons” (Edwards 2001, 75). And their observers suggested the occupation was not well organized.</p>
<p>Still police right away put in motion plans to move more than 200 officers to the area along with caged Corrections Canada buses (Edwards 2001, 75). The Forest arena was commandeered as an arrest center. Police had also made arrangements with the Canadian military for use of armored personnel carriers. Project Maple was underway. The social war character of the police operation and response to Indigenous occupiers was unescapable. It would soon claim its casualties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Assault on Ipperwash and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday, September 5, and Wednesday, September 6, 1995, dozens of out of town officers appeared in the area near the camp and park. There was a mass mobilization of police force which seemed well out of proportion given the small numbers of community occupiers and the peaceful, by all accounts, nature of the protest.</p>
<p>Police roadblocks were set up on roads around the park and drivers were stopped and questioned. Indigenous drivers and passengers were subjected to particularly lengthy interrogations by police. The night of the police assault police shut down all roads around the park and military base sealing the protesters off from the outside world. Dozens of police vehicles, including containment vans, had been massed outside the park.</p>
<p>Numerous people, like Kettle and Stony Point band councillor Cecil Bernard, told OPP officers during the occupation that the occupiers were “good, peaceful people” (Edwards 2001, 1). They also noted that they felt that the officers did not care or were almost disappointed to hear this.</p>
<p>On the evening of the lethal police raid that killed Dudley George there were only about 25 people inside the park and this included some children (Edwards 2001, 2). The occupiers had no weapons in the park. In fact weapons had been banned by occupiers who realized they could not win in a shootout with police, which they did not seek anyway, and having weapons could be potentially disastrous.</p>
<p>The police maneuvers that resulted in the killing of Dudley George were military in character. The riot squad, the Crowd Management Unit, that moved on the camp was made up of the OPP Tactics and Rescue Unit (TRU) a paramilitary formation (Edwards 2001, 3). They consisted of scouts and snipers. It was never quite clear how the decision to send in the TRU was ever arrived at and ordered.</p>
<p>At one point earlier in the evening they had almost claimed a different victim, also unarmed. A TRU sniper had eyed what he believed to be an Indigenous person with a rifle standing at the side of the road. He also saw what he believed to be the reddish glow from a night vision riffle scope. What happened next is chilling. The officer reported into his radio: “CMU [Crowd Management Unit] be advised party on road may have a weapon in his hand. Check CMU person on the road does have a weapon, does have a weapon. Everybody move. Right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, everybody quick right. Left” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 3). The sniper dropped into position taking aim on the figure, awaiting the order to “Fire.” The man was that close to being dead. As automatic weapons trained on him snipers confirmed the perceived threat. A police scout: “Confirm one man with weapon—long gun” (Edwards 2001, 3). That close.</p>
<p>But the police were mistaken. A message from Constable Mark Beauchene to Acting Sergeant Ken Deane clarified that the man in the crosshairs did not actually have a gun at all. He carried a walking stick. The red glow from the night sight—a lit cigarette (Edwards 2001, 3). And he was that close to being killed right then and there. Under eerily similar circumstances of police error and confusion Dudley George would not escape with such fortune.</p>
<p>Still the CMU continued their ill advised march on the camp. Near the park entrance protesters would see about 30 of them marching toward them in a tight box formation. Years before concerns would be more constantly raised about the militarization of policing, this formation of the riot squad came forward in head to toe body armor, with shin and elbow pads, holding Plexiglas shields and steel batons. They wore heavy helmets not meant to communicate with those they were approaching (to serve and protect of course). Rather their intended communications were only with each other. The helmets were equipped with internal microphones.</p>
<p>Police began pounding on the shields with their batons, “shield chatter,” in the tried and true attempt to intimidate, distract, and terrorize. This was nothing less than a military formation on a military maneuver. It was designed to frighten and threaten and, if necessary, to inflict lethal force. It had no other purpose or intent.</p>
<p>In response the protesters were not fully intimidated. Some turned high powered spotlights on the officers. Lights, symbolically, ironically, illuminating a situation from the history of Canadian settler colonialism—the deployment of military force to drive Indigenous people off of their lands. And the protesters were explicit that they recognized and understood this. They responded to the CMU appropriately: “This is our traditional land. Our forefathers were here before you! Get back on the <em>Mayflower</em>! Go back with the Pilgrims” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). And: “You’re stealing our land! Go back to England! Get the fuck off our land!” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). The land reclaimers were justly defiant. They were no aggressive or violent. None of that mattered to police who were impatient to deploy force against the protesters (for reasons not immediately apparent perhaps but politically significant).</p>
<p>Riot squad officers initially made a raid against Indigenous people in the parking lot. Police adopted a spread formation, standing wide apart to look more menacing and to avoid projectiles (Edwards 2001, 5). Moments later the police charged the group again. Indigenous protesters were beaten, at least one into unconsciousness. Later in the attack a dog that was with the protesters would be shot and killed by police. In the end, in addition to Dudley George, 16-year-old Nicholas Cottrelle would also be shot in the volleys of dozens of bullets fired by police at Indigenous protesters. Cecil Slippery George would be beaten almost to death by police. A dog that was with Cottrelle on a bus the youth tried to drive out of danger was also shot and killed.</p>
<p>Ken “Tex” Deane, the officer  who shot and killed Dudley George, was armed with an East German Heckler and Koch submachine gun. It fired 800 rounds a minute. Deane had been on duty for sixteen hours. Another officer, Sergeant George Hebblethwaite, second in command of the riot squad, recognized that George appeared to be holding only a stick (Edwards 2001, 10). Yet, in what would be found in a trial and inquiry after the killing to be unwarranted and unjustifiable use of force, Deane opened fire anyway. Deane hit George with what were the second and third volleys of bullets he fired. The third volley delivered the lethal shot.</p>
<p>Dudley George&#8217;s sister Carolyn and brother Pierre tried  frantically to get their stricken sibling to the local hospital for urgently needed care. They placed him in a car and made a desperate run for the hospital. What played out was an horrific expression of police vengeance and pettiness. Police attempted at every turn to stop the vehicle carrying the badly wounded Dudley George and the frantic effort to save his life saw the vehicle circumvent several would be roadblocks and out-maneuver the police pursuit.  Incredibly they managed to get Dudley to Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital in Strathroy, Ontario. The nightmare did not end when they got there.</p>
<p>Police chose to arrest and detain Pierre George and Carolyn George, who delivered Dudley to the hospital, rather than get the dying man immediate medical attention. Young Nicolas Cottrelle, only 16, who was also shot by police would  himself be charged by police with attempted murder. With 28 blunt force trauma wounds across his body delivered by police, Slippery George was charged with assault. The laying of charges against people who have been violently attacked by police is a standard practice that is all too familiar to people who have engaged in political protests in Canada. It is a practice that has become routine.</p>
<p>Dudley’s brother Pierre and sister Carolyn, who had so desperately tried to save their brother’s life were put in the Strathroy town jail and each charged with attempted murder. Police at the jail refused to answer Pierre George’s repeated requests to find out how Dudley was. Somehow though they knew.</p>
<p>Dudley George suffered fractures of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs on his left side, a cracked collar bone, and had two large fragments of bullets in the subcutaneous soft tissues (Edwards 2001, 20). The young man, a beloved jokester, was declared dead at 12:20 AM on September 7, 1995, at nearby Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, in Strathroy, Ontario.</p>
<p>Anthony O&#8217;Brien George (March 17, 1957–September 7, 1995), known to friends and family as Dudley, was the eighth of ten children born to Geneviève (“Jenny”) Pauline Rogers George and Reg “Nug” (Reginald Ransford) George.</p>
<p>Kettle and Stony Point Chief, Tom Bressette, described the sense of terror inflicted on the community by police. In his words: “Our elders were fleeing the community&#8230;They were afraid the army would come back with the police and kill them” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 22). The history of violence inflicted on the community and the immediate killing of their neighbor Dudley gave them ample reason to feel threatened. As would be revealed in the pubic inquiry held years later the community without fully knowing it perhaps had larger political reasons to be fearful. The government was fully prepared to deploy, indeed desired, police terror against the community to break the occupation.</p>
<p>The morning after the killing of Dudley George, Premier Harris refused to meet with Chief Bressette, Assembly of First Nations head Ovid Mercredi, and Ontario Chief Gord Peters. Harris referred to the occupation as illegal even though senior government ministers knew it was likely fully legal given the existence of burial grounds in the park (Edwards 2001, 118). The claim of Indigenous illegality was a claim Harris would repeat publicly even days later. After the killing the military tried to denigrate Dudley George by suggesting he had an “extreme criminal record” (Edwards 2001, 116). This was in no way accurate. He had one arrest as a youth (in an event for which white youth also involved were never even charged).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racism and Colonialism Continued: Law and Order Conservatism and the Ipperwash Siege</p>
<p>The community members believed early on that Conservative Premier Mike Harris was responsible for the lethal police operation. Harris and his hard Right neoliberal Conservative Party government had only been elected three months before the killing of Dudley George. His government had made clear in their election campaign that they would make poor and working class communities scapegoats for social discontent and economic uncertainty. The suffering of the poor and unemployed would pay for social programs desired by the wealthy (through a massive transfer of social wealth away from services needed by the poorest members of society). They were an openly reactionary force for capital and fierce proponents of a neoliberal austerity agenda and tough on crime politics of repression.</p>
<p>Under the banner of their so-called “Common Sense Revolution” the Harris Tories launched a counter-revolutionary assault against poor people, welfare recipients, unions, students, community groups, and progressives of all types. At one point a year into his term Harris would target even sociologists (who were critical of anti-social government policy) labeling the discipline as “waste in the system” of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>Harris had, as official Opposition leader, made his racist views on Indigenous communities, and common sense, known to a group of business people (his people) at the Elmhurst Resort near Peterborough. According to Harris: “There’s a whole notion of guilt&#8230;because Native people haven’t fully adapted from the reservations [reserves] to being full partners in this economy. We can’t let that guilt preclude us from reaching a common sense solution” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 26). Common sense to Harris was justification for ongoing colonialism. Hs was, on the whole, an agenda of ramped up violence in service of primitive accumulation and renewed conditions for exploitation more favorable to capital (against policies and programs that offered some buffer for the working class and oppressed.</p>
<p>Among the changes introduced early by Premier Harris was the ending of employment equity legislation that would have had employers make plans to hire visible minorities, women, and Indigenous people (Edwards 2001, 26). This was the common sense counter-revolution for Ontario. Notably this agenda would be taken nationally when the revamped Conservative Party under Stephen Harper came to power between 2005 and 2015 with several veterans of Harris’s Common Sense Revolution as ministers in the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>From the start police were aware that they were being watched closely by the Premier’s office and Conservative Party. The first day of the operation Conservative MPP Marcel Beaubien arrived on the scene and was in communication with the government at Queen’s Park. The earliest government meetings expressed an intention to “remove the occupiers ASAP” (Edwards 2001, 80). The Conservative Party had campaigned on a hard law and order platform of zero tolerance for even minor offenses and the quelling of political dissent. The Premier’s office sought to use the excuse of break and enter or property damage to push it law and order agenda and sought signs of weapons.</p>
<p>Conservative MPP Beaubien released a press statement replaying racist claims about a two-tiered justice system that was soft on Natives, compared, again in racist fashion, to non[-Native people who were presented as “law abiding and tax paying citizens” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). The Indigenous community members were described as “irresponsible, law breaking dissidents” despite the fact that the occupation had not been declared illegal by anyone formally or charges prepared (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). These claims played on racist tropes familiar in the history of Canadian colonialism and cultural erasure of Indigenous peoples. To add a further racist plum MPP Beaubien tried to distinguish between “your decent native citizen” and “thugs” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). Another referent from Canadian colonial discourse.</p>
<p>MPPs like Beaubien were ratcheting up tensions and calling on the Premier’s office for a forceful and swift intervention. Pressure was also coming from Conservative Party supporters. A letter from a local lawyer to the government was circulated saying in part: “The Conservative government had a large law and order plank in its platform—I want to see it live up to its election promises and my expectations. I want to see Ipperwash Provincial Park remain in the public domain, and I want the law enforced to see that it does” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). The letter writer raised the clichéd specter of anarchy and showed little regard for the wellbeing of protesters: “The time to act, and act decisively, is now. If people are hurt, so be it—the laws must be enforced to be respected&#8230;.If illegal acts are tolerated, they spread. The end result is anarchy” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). This from a lawyer promoting illegal police action against Indigenous people who, on the basis of the known burial site on the lands were not actually acting illegally (which it turns out the government was aware of). An open call for potential extrajudicial execution of land defenders.</p>
<p>Ironically the statement offered a note that expressed the very situation of the Indigenous community that had waited 50 years to get their land back. It read: “People begin to perceive the government cannot protect them and their interests—they begin to take steps to protect themselves” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). Meant as a threat this actually explained the situation of the land reclaimers who were being targeted for condemnation.</p>
<p>The appeals of the non-Natives and the racist messaging was not lost o the government which agreed with such sentiments. In meetings of the provincial Emergency Planning Committee, notes show clearly that the Conservative government would accept no compromise and would accept nothing, in fact, except the forced removal of the reclaimers. The government would not negotiate. Neither would they consider, incredibly, that the Indigenous people actually had legitimate claims on the lands. This intransigence was in place even as experts informed them that there were no legal grounds for removal of the occupiers. Stunningly, the government’s own files contained proof of the existence of the burial ground inside the park.</p>
<p>The government had already decided to seek an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the Indigenous protesters. This would ban them from making any argument of their case in the courts, excluding them from the process. It was a measure usually reserved for extreme cases (Edwards 2001, 91). Excluded from the hearing they could not argue or provide evidence for their reasons for being on the land. The police were granted the <em>ex parte</em> injunction for four days.</p>
<p>Notes show that the government asked police to remove the protesters and showed frustration that the police did not do so immediately. The government wanted “to be seen as acting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 89). The government even rejected possible assistance from Kettle and Stony Point band chief Tom Bressette. According to notes: “This government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 90).</p>
<p>Racism played an active part in the approach taken by police as well as by government. Protesters reported police hurling racist epithets at them throughout the occupation and police assault on the reclamation camp and saying Dudley George, by name, would “be the first” (Edwards 2001, 86). Police communication suggested that Native occupiers had been drinking even though there was no sign they were drinking and that they had, in fact, said they wanted no drinking among people at the site. According to police transcripts, OPP Superintendent Anthony Parkin said of the land reclaimers: “They’re probably all boozed up. They’ve probably been drinking” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 98). The police also suggested cynically that some occupiers were leaving because they knew trouble was coming. Yet they had actually left because they had school and jobs to go to (Edwards 2001, 98). This fact never occurred to police steeped in colonial racist ideology of unemployed, uneducated, Natives. The police also played on racist constructions of Indigenous people as untrustworthy and crooked. Toward this end the police spread rumors in the local area about native occupiers stealing gas. This was designed to stoke suspicion and anger among local farmers, business people, and town residents.</p>
<p>Police and government documents would show a close relationship between the provincial government and the OPP, even in contravention of law and public policy separating government from policing operations. OPP Commissioner Thomas O’Grady was a member of a joint crisis team that met regularly beginning one month before Dudley George was killed by police. So close was the relationship that the OPP had been nicknamed the “Ontario Political Police” (Edwards 2001, 120). The joint team was viewed as a legitimate vehicle <em>for</em> government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social War Policing and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>In a case that underlines the state-capital nexus in policing, and the police as social war defenders of capital, the police also received an armored personnel carrier directly from the manufacturer, GM Diesel, in the nearby city of London, Ontario. Of note, the factory had a special agreement with the London police to provide it armored vehicles in times of police need. The only conceivable possible need was crowd control and anti-protest maneuvers.</p>
<p>The  infamous Chief of Police for London at the time, one Julian Fantino (known for racial profiling during his time as chief in York, Ontario and for keeping a list of gay men while in London) agreed to loan a vehicle to the OPP for the siege of Ipperwash. Fantino would, several years later, be head of the OPP at the time of the Six Nations occupation at Caledonia, Ontario. There the police would notoriously assault the occupation in violation of the recommendations that arose following the police murder of Dudley George. OPP under Fantino would also protect white supremacists who sought to attack the Six Nations reclamation.</p>
<p>The military nature of the police action was further reinforced with the use of air cover through helicopter flyovers. Occupiers had noted surveillance by low flying police helicopters as well as shoreline patrols by a police boat. The Indigenous land reclaimers were being encircled on land and in the air. And even by water. Around the clock. This was a full on military siege. At the same time they actually consisted of a grand total of nine people, including three children (Edwards 2001, 80). At one point a police helicopter buzzed so low on a picnic of women and children that it blew their food off the table (Edwards 2001, 86).</p>
<p>The OPP made informal requests for help to the Canadian military. OPP were in communication with the military over a plan to outnumber Natives ten to one (rather than the two to one ratio in effect when Dudley George was killed). Unfortunately for their plan available troops were preparing to fight an external imperial battle in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance and Police Spies</p>
<p>As in traditional military operations the state also deployed special ops against the occupiers. At least one spy provided information over a period of time to both CSIS and the OPP. The one identified spy was Jim Moses, a journalist who had contributed to various Indigenous media as well as mainstream outlets like the state broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and its investigative newsmagazine <em>The Fifth Estate</em> (Edwards 2001, 69). CSIS was particularly interested in involvement by or connections with the Mohawk Warrior Society, noted for activism and community defense at Akwesasne and Oka. Moses reported being paid around $2000 by the OPP over almost three years of spying on Indigenous groups. CSIS paid between 400 dollars and 800 dollars per month (Edwards 2001, 69).</p>
<p>Notably, over his period with the Stoney Point occupiers Moses could find and report no wrongdoing by the group. This despite the fact that it would have been beneficial financially for him to do so. Moses went on to stay with the occupiers at the military base. He never saw any guns at the occupation. He regarded Dudley George as a joker rather than a fighter or leader (Edwards 2001, 70). He expressed deep sadness at George’s killing. In his words: “Dudley was a happy-go-lucky friendly guy&#8230;I was sick. I felt empty&#8230;It was totally unnecessary” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 70). This from the police infiltrator.</p>
<p>The OPP also used officers posing as tourists to spy on Indigenous people along the park beach. In addition two undercover officers were placed in the camp posing as campers. They operated out of a trailer and a mobile home (Edwards 2001, 70). Notably they too had nothing threatening or ominous to report about the activities of the occupiers.</p>
<p>The OPP’s military Tactics and Rescue Unit had been formed specifically to address terrorism (in the period before 9/11). It’s deployment and dubious use in this situation show both the government view of Indigenous land defense and the misuse for purely politically opportunistic purposes various “anti-terror” mechanisms. Notably the police construction of Indigenous land defenders as terrorists continues in recent surveillance and response to Indigenous pipeline resistance in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The police, despite massive surveillance and  an infiltrator in the occupation camp, had no evidence, at any point, of any danger posed by the land reclaimers.  Yet the government took the extreme measure of gaining an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the occupiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Inquiry and a Killer Cop Convicted</p>
<p>In a rare turn of events in the Canadian state context, where police are almost never charged or brought to trial for killing civilian, the officer who killed Dudley George, Acting Sergeant Ken “Tex” Deane was actually charged and his case tried in a court of law. Deane put forward a defense that he believed Dudley George to be carrying a rifle at the time he shot the young man. The presiding judge did not accept this Defense and found Deane’s claims to lack credibility, a rare conclusion regarding police officer testimony in cases where officers are charged for killing someone. According to Judge Hugh Fraser: “I find, sir, that you were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Ontario Provincial Police investigators. You were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Special Investigations Unit of the Province of Ontario. You were not honest in maintaining this ruse before this court” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 198). Deane was found guilty of criminal negligence but sentenced to a non-custodial punishment. For killing Dudley George in cold blood Tex Deane was given a conditional sentence of two years less a day which was to be served in the community (Edwards 2001, 214).</p>
<p>Despite the conviction, Tex Deane did not lose his job as a police officer. He maintained his employment with the force for five-and-a-half years following the criminal conviction. Over that time Officer Deane appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal and eventually all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Finally, in the wake of a hearing under the Police Act, Deane was additionally convicted of Discreditable Conduct. He was given the option of resigning within seven days or being fired and left the force. Deane would go on to work as a security guard, unsettlingly, at an Ontario Hydro nuclear station.</p>
<p>Tex Deane was killed in a car accident on February 25, 2006. Ironically perhaps, his vehicle collided with a truck near Prescott, Ontario while Deane was traveling to testify in the provincial inquiry called into the government handling of the Ipperwash crisis (Harris 2006).</p>
<p>Following the police killing of Dudley George the George family made ongoing calls for both the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to strike a public inquiry into the handling of the response to the land reclamation at Ipperwash by the province and the police. They wanted to know especially the nature and extent of government involvement in directing police operations against the Indigenous community protesters.</p>
<p>Finally, on November 12, 2003, a public inquiry was launched in Ontario. This only happened after the ruling Conservative Party lost the election of 2003 to the Liberal Party headed by Dalton McGuinty. The Conservatives had held to power and refused an inquiry into their actions for eight years.</p>
<p>While the inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario it was carried out under a third party, Sidney B. Linden, who was deemed to be neutral. Linden derived his authority as a commissioner as covered by the Public Inquiries Act (Ontario). The public inquiry was given the specific mandate to examine and report on the events surrounding the killing of Dudley George. This was not a trial and no punishment would be levied. It was expected that the inquiry would provide recommendations covering interactions between police and Indigenous communities in future events of similar nature to the Ipperwash protests.</p>
<p>Evidence provided over the course of the inquiry was damning of the Conservative government’s racism and contempt for Indigenous communities. It also showed dubious government relationships with police and pointed to government pressures on policing in the nature of a police state. At one point a 17-minute tape recording was submitted that revealed a stunning conversation between OPP Inspector Ron Fox and Inspector John Carson, the OPP commander in charge of the Ipperwash case before Dudley George was killed. The two officers discussed Premier Mike Harris&#8217;s aggressive and racist perspective that that the government has “tried to pacify and pander to these people far too long” and to use “swift affirmative action” to remove the Indigenous people from the park (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). It could be said that this was the only time in his period in office that Mike Harris supported any form of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Perhaps most damning was shocking evidence provided by former Ontario Provincial Attorney General Charles Harnick on November 28, 2005. Harniick testified that Premier Harris used extreme profanity while shouting, “I want the fucking Indians out of my park” (Ipperwash Public Inquiry 2005).</p>
<p>Former Premier Mike Harris did appear reluctantly before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. Harris denied in his testimony that he had ever made the statement attributed to him by Harnick (CBC News 2006). Notably, Justice Linden “found the statements were made and they were racist, whether intended or not” (Ipperwash Inquiry, Volume 1 2007, 677).</p>
<p>The evidentiary hearings portion of the inquiry ended on June 28, 2006. The final report from Justice Linden and the overall findings of the inquiry were released on May 31, 2007 (CBC News 2007). They concluded that the Premier’s office and the police had acted inappropriately and improperly in the events at Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not in Vain: Victory to the Occupiers and the Return of the Lands</p>
<p>The killing of Dudley George can only be considered a state atrocity, an extrajudicial execution carried out on behalf of a government that sought to show it was tough of protesters and, more, an upholder of the colonial power relations at the heart of the Canadian state. But Dudley George’s death was not in vain. His people would emerge victorious in this particular struggle despite the efforts of the Ontario government. Unfortunately this victory, and confirmation of the rightness of their struggle, would only come 12 years after Dudley George was killed.</p>
<p>On December 20, 2007, the Ontario Provincial government, now under Liberal Party direction, made a public announcement that it would finally return the full acreage of Ipperwash Provincial Park to its proper inhabitants, the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (Gillespie 2007). This initial announcement did not make full return of the lands immediately since the land was placed under co-management by the provincial government and the Indigenous communities for an unspecified period of time. The government also announced that there would be consultations carried out with nearby local communities (non-Indigenous). Then-Aboriginal Affairs Minister Michael Bryant suggested that the land would be turned over to full Chippewa control at the end of this consultation process.</p>
<p>The date finally came on Thursday May 28, 2009, when then-Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid formally signed control of Ipperwash Park over to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (McCaffery 2009). The full settlement was only finalized on April 14, 2016, a delay for the community of more than 70 years after the government’s promised return of the end of World War Two. The land was turned over to the community along with a  payment of $95 million. The Federal government was represented in the signing over by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan and Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Dr. Carolyn Bennett. Signing the agreement on behalf of the First Nation was Chief Thomas Bressette (Bridge 2016).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some members of the community have opposed the agreement as too little too late. Pierre George was engulfed in flames during a protest prior to the signing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CODA: They are the Government. We Can Never Trust the Police</p>
<p>Peter Edwards gives a sense of the hegemonic view of policing held by most media members, but which Indigenous communities hold with skepticism. According to the reporter:</p>
<p>“It’s a basic understanding in a democracy that police keep a professional distance from politicians It has to be this way. Otherwise, police would soon find themselves ordered to crack down on the political rivals of whoever is in office, ass happens in Third World police states. That would be the certain death of democracy.” (Edwards 2001, 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well then democracy in Canada is already dead. Killed by police. As each of the cases of activists killed by police in Canada shows the ruling politicians and political parties do not keep a distance from police. Regularly they engage with, direct, and/or pressure police to act with violence <em>for political purposes</em> and <em>toward political ends</em>. The police killing of Dudley George was no different in this respect.</p>
<p>One Indigenous woman offered an alternative view of the hegemonic perspective on [police as peacekeepers. In her view: “They [the police] are the government. We can never trust the police” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 25). This is a clear sighted and correct criminological analysis of the historic and contemporary character of policing in Canada. Despite what the national mythologies might have one believe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>The woman killed by Toronto police on January 2, 2017 has been identified as Amleset Haile. The 60 year-old native of Ethiopia was living at a home on St. Clarens Avenue, a Houselink home for people with mental health and addiction issues, when police killed her. Amleset Haile’s name has only been released publicly now. While the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency responsible for investigating cases of civilians harmed by police in Ontario, is investigating the killing it has not released her name.</p>
<p>Police arrived at the home near Bloor and Lansdowne Streets in west Toronto at 4:45 AM on January 2 in response to a report of an emotionally distraught woman threatening suicide. Only 15 minutes later, about 5 AM, Amleset Haile was wheeled out on a stretcher, not moving, her neck held in a brace. The woman would die two  days later in hospital after being taken off of life support.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered in the month following her death at the hands of police. And family, friends, and neighbors want answers. Among the questions are why a home for people with mental health issues sis not have trained staff available to assist a distraught woman. Another question concerns why such a home would call police first rather than health care providers. Other questions involve what exactly police did to the woman and why and how did she sustain severe trauma to her body within 15 minutes of police activity. The SIU has not confirmed any police claims about the incident.</p>
<p>Friend Jennifer Cox witnessed part of the incident and believes Haile was in fear and running from police. She does not believe the frail woman was strong enough to lift herself up to jump from a window or balcony. Cox, like others, wonders if the situation involving her friend could have ended differently had a mental health caregiver  been called and responded instead of police.</p>
<p>The Toronto Police Department does have Mobile Crisis Intervention Teams (MCIT), roving units made up of a specially trained police officer and a mental-health nurse. Despite repeated recommendations and calls coming from coroner’s inquests these crisis teams are not available 24-hours a day. And none are available between 11 PM and 6 AM, what can be desperate overnight hours.</p>
<p>In the view of Steve Lurie, executive director of the Toronto branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, there should be an expansion of hours of specialized mental health units. As he puts it: “If the call was ‘we think someone is suicidal,’ it makes more sense to bring mental health professionals to bear if they are available” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p>
<p>On the whole far more resources should be put into independent mental health sources and resources in cities across Canada. Yet public funding is overwhelmingly given to police departments, at the expense of mental health care, harm reduction, support services, health care services for poor people, etc. Police departments continue to  make up the greatest part of city budgets while mental health funding and resources are slashed.</p>
<p>Amleset Haile is remembered by friends and the community organizations she was active in as generous, caring, and kind. She contributed to her communities through groups like Houselink and Sistering, a group for homeless and poor women in Toronto.</p>

Within 72 hours of the indigenous community occupation at Ipperwash Provincial Park, one of the community’s members, Anthony O’Brien (Dudley) George was dead. He had been shot and killed by an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Kenneth “Tex” Deane, who had fired multiple rounds from an assault weapon at the non-threatening and unarmed George.</p>
<p>After the shooting of Dudley George many questions began to be asked. What role did the Ontario government play in pushing the OPP to move on the occupiers? Why did the OPP decide to march on the occupiers, taking an aggressive and confrontational approach (a full frontal assault) when there were already plans developed to address the situation through less aggressive means? Why were the OPP armed so heavily and with assault with assault weapons when it was known through a CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Services) mole that the occupiers were unarmed?</p>
<p>Some partial answers to these questions would only come out in the criminal trial of Tex Deane and the public inquiry held a decade after George’s homicide by police. The shooting of Dudley George came a day after newly elected Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris ordered OPP to “get the fucking Indians out of Ipperwash Park” (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). An aide in the Premier’s office notoriously proclaimed: “The government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians.” This was only a day before Dudley George was shot and killed. Yet the deeper answers to these questions are rooted in the general history of colonialism and genocide in Canada and the specific harms inflicted on The Kettle Point and Stony Point communities.</p>
<p>At the heart of policing across the Canadian context is, as it always is in the case of settler colonialism, control of land, Indigenous land. In the Canadian state context policing has always been a military exercise in the service of displacement, dispossession, seizure, securing, and settling of land and, where deemed necessary, re-seizing and re-securing land in those cases where Indigenous communities have organized to reclaim their community lands. The examples in Canadian history are numerous and ongoing. A litany of state organized and state enacted theft. Nothing less. Organized crime at the highest level. The names of incidents of state violence in the seizure of Indigenous lands live in infamy. So too the cases of police assaults carried out in the re-taking of land re-claimed by Indigenous communities. Oka, Gustafsen Lake, Sun Peaks, Caledonia, to name only a few recent ones. And Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Ongoing History of Colonial Crimes: Always an Ipperwash Crisis for Indigenous People</p>
<p>The great Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, whose relations moved to Kettle Point, received a lecture from his older brother Chiksika. He said:</p>
<p>“When a white man kills an Indian in a fair fight it is called honorable, but when an Indian kills a white man in a fair fight it is called murder&#8230; When an Indian is killed it is a great loss which leaves a gap in our people and a sorrow in our heart; when a white is killed, three or four others step up to take his place and there is no end to it. The white man seeks to conquer nature, to bend it to his will and use it wastefully&#8230;The whole white race is a monster who is always hungry and what he eats is land.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 33)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of the OPP Ipperwash police assault and the killing of Dudley George is rooted in a historic theft of land by the Canadian government for purposes of war. On July 10, 1827, Chief Wawanosh would conclude a treaty that would see King George IV acquire around 2,200,000 acres of prime land in Southwestern Ontario. The treaty would see the establishment of the Kettle and Stony Point reserves with a measly 5000 acres combined. The treaty conference that gave rise to the Kettle and Stony Point reserves came from a concern over land squatting (theft) by white settlers. In return the Indigenous communities received a promise that the Crown would provide living payments “annually and forever” (Edwards 2001, 39). Yet the Crown came to this agreement clearly intending that forever would be a very short time, if the Indigenous population decreased and, indeed, disappeared. The genocidal intentions, or at least expectations, of government, settlers, and missionaries were not hidden beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Primitive accumulation in the Canadian context occurred according to a brutal explicit calculus. This was made clear in crude terms by Reverend Thomas Hurlburt, Methodist missionary to Kettle and Stony Point and the city of Sarnia. In 1864 Reverend Hurlburt wrote in a piece in the <em>Lambton County Gazeteer and Genneral Business Directory</em> to lay out the mathematics of genocide for the general public. He stated:</p>
<p>“This is the easiest and cheapest way to dispose of the Indians of North America; for they must be disposed of in one of three ways; killed in war or by drink or Christianized by missionaries and thus made useful members of society&#8230;</p>
<p>“Having been in the mission among the Indians for the past 35 years, and having lived and labored among them in that capacity, I am acquainted with most of the tribes from Texas to the Hudson’s Bay territory, as well as in Canada, I have taken pains to gather the statistics of various Indian wars—the Florida, Black Hawks and others, and I find it requires $25,000 to dispose of an Indian by war, in addition to one white man being killed for every Indian. To dispose of them by drink I found by the statistics of those tribes who had large annuities, and consequently drunk much, that it required about $2,000 to kill an Indian by whiskey&#8230;</p>
<p>“In taking the statistics of our own Indian missions, I find it requires about $200 to Cristianize and civilize an Indian, and train him twenty years and thus give him a chance for both his life and that which is to come. Thus it is seen that it requires as much to kill an Indian in war as would Christianize 125, and train them twenty years. It requires as much to kill an Indian by whiskey as would Christianize and save ten. There are 125,000 Indians in British North America.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 41)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the market calculus, the marketization of genocide. It is the logic that would give rise to the horrors of the residential schools and cultural erasure. This is the ongoing logic of colonialism that would find expression, sometimes explicit, in the Ipperwash crisis. It has economic, political, and cultural aspects.</p>
<p>A letter sent by agent A. Dingman of Strathroy to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald on August 27, 1884 and marked “Confidential” told a story of systematic theft of the resources of the reserve lands. In the letter Dingman recorded the activities of a timber mill owner A.L. Smith who operated in the area. The mill had been set up by the capitalist to ensure cloaked thievery. Noting that white settlers had stripped non-reserve lands of resources, Dingman reports:</p>
<p>“and there is now absolutely no place from which it is practicable to get logs with which to stock the mill except they come off the Indian Reserves. It is situated in such an out-of-the-way place that any person so disposed could easily get logs off the Reserves and few people would be aware of the fact unless they were specially interested in finding it out&#8230;.If the object was to plunder the Reserves of timber no better place could be found than the spot where the mill is situated.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As was common across the area of Ontario, the capitalist represented himself as an agent of the government. Smith had even constructed a phony title for himself, “forest bailiff,” a position that did not actually exist in Ontario. In a scheme that brought together the recent push to Christianize the communities the capitalist concocted a deal to return some sawed boards to the community for sue in building a church the newly converted now wanted. As Dingman reported: “never a board was used on the church. This process was repeated time and time again until fully $5,000 worth of timber was cut and sawed into timber, but not one board went towards building the church” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42). Still the cutting for profit brought the woods to the point of being barren of trees.</p>
<p>Dingman suggested that the trees at Stony Point might not survive another winter of plunder (Edwards 2001, 42). While settlers for miles around had fences for their farms, the Native farmers had no wood for their own fences (Edwards 2001, 43).</p>
<p>There were no charges brought by the Government of Canada against any of the settlers or capitalists who had stolen from the Indigenous communities. Nor was anyone held responsible for government corruption or incompetence (Edwards 2001, 43). The government of Prime Minister Macdonald protected capitalist interests in Treaty 242 of 1888 which gave the federal government permission to sell Native timber rights in exchange for minimal cooperation. Notably the failure of the government to meet wartime promises to provide compensation for wartime service in the War of 1812 persisted throughout the community. Similar struggles would play out over service in subsequent wars up through the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1927 a group of land speculators with connections in Ottawa turned their greedy eyes to reserve lands on the shores of Lake Huron. Band members were offered bribes of five dollars if they voted to surrender the lands to developers. An additional ten dollars was offered if the vote to surrender the lands was approved by council (Edwards 2001, 45). Despite the fact that the lands were located at Kettle Point, the vote (and the bribes) were offered to men of both bands. In the end the 33 acres of parkland were purchased by speculators for eighty-five dollars per acre. Half was resold immediately by the developers who had a pre-existing deal for three hundred dollars and acre. The Kettle Point band received $7706.20 for land that developers received $13,200 in selling only half.</p>
<p>Years later the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the federal government had cheated the community as government Indian agents abandoned the duty to protect by looking away as the deal went down. By that point cottagers had held the land for generations (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>In 1936 the Stoney Point community were deprived of more of their land, when the Province of Ontario purchased 108 acres of land that had been sold the previous year to private actors (Edwards 2001, 46). The land would be used for none other than Ipperwash Provincial Park.</p>
<p>When workers preparing the park uncovered evidence of a Native burial ground appeals were made to government by band council to fence that area off from development. Despite official letters from provincial and federal governments approving of this request the fence was never built. The area would become a picnic grounds complete with horseshoe pits (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>The history of land theft by capital, settlers, and government against the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities would continue as war loomed in Europe in the late 1930s. The Canadian government desired a military training ground in Ontario (centrally located in the province with the country’s largest population). Businesses desired a facility in the area sine they could profit greatly servicing and supplying the base. Local businesses saw dollar signs in providing the base with fruit, vegetables, grains, bread, oil, canned goods, garbage removal, etc. as had been the  case with a base at Pinehill Camp (Edwards 2001, 46-47). That base was closed due to lack of running water on site, a great loss for profit seeking local capital. Stoney Point provided an ideal site right on the shores of Lake Huron and with water running all through it (Edwards 2001, 47).</p>
<p>In addition to its beneficial geographical qualities, Stoney Point offered a political benefit in that the Natives of Stoney Point did not have the vote and could not punish the government or local representatives at the voting booth. Another benefit for the government was financial. The Department of National Defence appraised the Stoney Point lands in 1942 at fifteen dollars per acre, which was much less than market value for nearby non-reserve lands. Economically, Native lands were viewed as “non-productive” (as long as Natives held them) despite the fact that they were directly farmed for food and essential for community purposes. The notion that Indigenous held lands were non-productive is one that returned to the center of federal government ideology under the Conservative Party regime of Stephen Harper in the 2000s as his government sought to convert Indigenous lands to marketable properties.</p>
<p>While the land deal would be put to a vote of the Stoney Point community a letter from the Secretary of Indian Affairs was sent to the local Indian agent stating that the government was “prepared to use the War Measures Act if the  Indians refused a surrender” (Edwards 2001, 47). Some vote then. Some democracy. Appropriately, on April Fools’ Day 1942 the Stoney Point band voted on the  fate of the lands. Members fighting overseas would not even get a vote. Under the government plan they would turn over the full 2211 acres of their land, all houses, and farms for a sum of $50,000.</p>
<p>Indigenous community members suggested a counter-proposal to lease the land to the federal government for the duration of the war but Ottawa rejected this. And why not? They had an ace up their sleeve. The vote showed a rejection of the government plan with the proposal being defeated 59-13 (Edwards 2001, 48). Never mind the “democratic” result. The government turned to their back up plan. On April 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order-in-council effecting an appropriation of the <em>entire</em> Stoney Point reserve.</p>
<p>Despite concerns among the federal Department of Justice about the legality of taking lands against the stated will of the community, the War Measures Act took the houses and land of the people of Stoney Point in the same manner as would also be imposed on supposed “enemy aliens” such as Japanese civilians (Edwards 2001, 48). Eighteen Stoney Point families were removed from their homes and lands and transferred to the Kettle Point reserve. They were merged into one band and reduced to one federally recognized chief. The Department of Indian Affairs which was supposed to look out for the interests of Indigenous communities (but rarely if ever did) raised not an eyebrow. In fact they viewed the move as a punitive measure to better oversee and regulate the people once they were in a closer space. One Indian agent even reported the dispossession and displacement as a great opportunity to round up a “few straggling Indians” (Edwards 2001, 49). To add insult to injury the government changed the name of the band from Stoney Point to Stony Point for unclear, bureaucratic, reasons. Their former land became Canadian Forces Base at Ipperwash (CFB Ipperwash).</p>
<p>Notably such a move for land expropriation would never have been considered against local white farmers or business property owners. Yet the area around the Stoney Point lands were being developed for less than essential purposes such as tourist resorts and weekend getaways for white visitors from the cities and from the United States. Those lands could have been appropriated with less impact on an existing community. The racist perspective of colonialism would not allow for consideration of such a move.</p>
<p>Residents of Stoney Point were moved without notification or even time to pack. As one displaced member Pearl George related: “When we came home, our house was up on jacks and our two log cabins were gone. They didn’t tell us anything&#8230;They never even let u know they were coming so we could pack up the little things. A lot of things were broken. They moved us to Kettle Point, to a swamp” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 49). Three of her children born at Kettle Point would die after developing intestinal problems that she attributed to the swamp[ water. The displaced felt like strangers in another land. As Maynard George, a son of Pearl, would state: It was sort of like in Bosnia where they put two different ethnic groups together. They did not allocate us good wood or housing. We could not become members of the band council or get any work on the reserve” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 50). This made no difference to government and likely never even registered at all. Other homes were simply levelled rather than moved. This was the fate suffered by the small church at Stoney Point as well as by many of the headstones in a nearby cemetery.</p>
<p>One can try to imagine the feelings of soldiers such as Clifford George who returned to a levelled land after having risked his life fighting in Europe (for the very state that was stealing and bulldozing his home while he faced enemy fire). He would  later reflect: “I came home to nothing. I’ll never forget the feeling I had when I first went there [to Stoney Point] and couldn’t find my mother’s grave. They had removed the headstones and there were bullet holes and trenches dug. They could only do that to an Indian. That would never happen to white people” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 52). With no home to return to George would move to a nearby town. He would be stripped of his legal Indian status. In his words: “I came back to find the real enemy was here” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 53).</p>
<p>The Canadian government had promised the Stony Point community that their lands would be returned to them at cessation of the fighting at war’s end. Following the end of World War Two the Transitional Powers Act replaced the War Measures Act setting the stage for a social transition to post-war conditions.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1946, the advanced infantry training center at CFB Ipperwash was closed. The Department of National Affairs and Department of Indian Affairs opened discussions about returning the confiscated lands to the Indigenous community. On December 31, 1946, the Transitional Powers Act expired and the stolen lands had still not been returned. Yet no extension was granted for the Department of National Defense to retain the Stony Point lands. The government had no legal basis to keep the lands. But it did.</p>
<p>In this context life went on. And grew. Dudley George was born on March 17, 1957 at Sarnia General Hospital. Anthony O’Brien George was the eighth of ten children in a family that lived at the Sarnia reserve after his family’s community was destroyed by the Canadian government 15 years before Dudley was born. Ironically he got his nickname Dudley after the character Dudley Do-Right a clueless Mountie featured in Saturday morning cartoons (Edwards 2001, 55). His family would move to Kettle Point when he was eight.</p>
<p>The efforts by Stony Point members to reclaim their land did not cease at any point during the period in which their lands were controlled by the Canadian government. Future Prime Minister Jean Chretien, then Minister of Indian Affairs noted in a letter to the Minister of National Defense in 1972:</p>
<p>“Since 1946 our respective Departments have been corresponding on the subject of the return of some 2,200 acres comprising Canadian Forces Base Camp Ipperwash which was appropriated in 1942 by the Department of National Defence under the War Measures Act&#8230;.</p>
<p>“The Chippewas of Kettle Point have repeatedly requested the return of these lands which are needed to enable the Band to improve its economic and social position. Time has not altered the Indians’ view that they were wronged by the forcible taking of their reserve in 1942. Moreover, it was their understanding that the land was to have been returned to them at the end of hostilities.</p>
<p>“With cuts in the Canadian Forces Bases indicated it seems to me that this is an appropriate time to reconsider this matter and I would appreciate having advice as to your Department’s plans for Camp Ipperwash. The transfer of this land to the administration and control of this Department so that it could be returned to reserve status would be of great importance to the Kettle Point Indians and would remove a major source of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Federal Government have dealt with this reserve.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 58)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing came of this of course. Of note, Chretien had become Prime Minister of Canada at the time the Ipperwash reclamation occupation, and shooting of Dudley George, occurred. Yet he did nothing as Prime Minister to improve a situation of injustice that he was clearly aware needed to be redressed and had be aware of for decades.</p>
<p>In 1950 the park superintendent’s wife had reported the discovery of human bones. By 1972 the government seemed to have forgotten about all discussions around fencing off the burial ground or about the discovery of bones.</p>
<p>The Canadian government made a payment of 2.5 million dollars to the Kettle and Stony Point band in 1980 as partial compensation for the base lands. This was accompanied by a promise that the lands would be returned when military use had finally ceased (Edwards 2001, 60). In March 1992 a report was tabled by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal People recommending that the federal government return the Camp Ipperwash lands to the Stony Point community.</p>
<p>The people themselves followed this recommendation up a month later when a gathering of 100 showed up at Camp Ipperwash to serve an eviction notice on the Department of National Defense. The government was given 20 days to leave the premises (Edwards 2001, 61). The group of 100 included members of the National Association of Japanese Canadians. Their representative Van Hori noted that his community had also lost their homes and had their land expropriated by the government during World War Two. He stated: “It took us forty-six years to get an apology and some kind of compensation&#8230;These people are still waiting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 61). The Department of National Defense replied in August 1992 that there was still a need to keep the Camp Ipperwash lands.</p>
<p>For many in the community the time for waiting was over. Fifty years had passed since the government stole the lands. Forty-six years since the promised time of return. On May 27, 1993 the military base was reoccupied by an Indigenous group calling itself now the Stoney Point First Nation. They named the reclaimed lands Aushoodaana Anjibaajrg meaning “resting place.” Dudley George was among that original group of land reclaimers.</p>
<p>The occupiers built homes on the base, pitched tents, parked trailers. The soldiers at the base remained doing what exercises they could. The occupation grew to around 100 residents with dozens more visiting regularly and offering support. Indigenous groups from across Turtle Island sent visitors. The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) offered solidarity in the form of timber for buildings and generators for power (Edwards 2001, 62). The happiness in the community was real. As Clifford George stated: “This is the first time in fifty years, since before the war, that we’ve all been together so close. We’re finally back together again, and that’s why we have such a good relationship&#8230;.I’m back to stay. They’ll have to carry me off and they better lock me up because the minute they let me loose, I’ll come back again” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 62). The community elected its own chief and council (outside the formal structures of the colonial Indian Act). This was an assertion of self-determination and self-governance. Traditional teachings were practiced. A peace tree was planted over a traditional stone axe. A month in the first permanent structure, a church, was completed (Edwards 2001, 63).</p>
<p>The military kept up low level Bell 212 helicopter flights for reconnaissance shining lights into the occupation camp. According to Clifford George: “Sometimes they flew so low they raised dust. They scare the kids and old people. I’m all in favour of laying of charges of harassment against the military” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 64). The helicopter crews that harassed the Stoney Point people had flown missions in the colonial deployment in Somalia.</p>
<p>The media war was also initiated against the Indigenous occupiers. Media began to portray them as terrorists not as a cheated community striving after decades to get their stolen lands back. In this the media were replaying by now well rehearsed narratives of Indigenous resistance as terrorism or criminality. Such discourses had only recently been trotted out and repeated for national and even international audiences during the Oka crisis of 1990.</p>
<p>In the federal budget speech of 1994 the government announced plans to negotiate the return of Camp Ipperwash lands. No date was given.</p>
<p>Enough was finally more than enough. On July 29, 1995, Stoney Point occupiers drove a yellow school bus through the doors of a base hall and refused to leave. The military simply withdrew. By the end of summer community members had secured contracts to maintain the base at ten dollars per hour. There was no violence.</p>
<p>On Monday, September 4, Labor Day, 1995, the Indigenous protesters occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park, as they had, in fact, promised to do. There were about 35 occupiers in the park on the first evening. Police knew from the start that this occupation differed from other recent occupations such as Oka in Quebec and Gustafsen Lake in British Columbia. Their own briefing notes reported “no visible weapons” (Edwards 2001, 75). And their observers suggested the occupation was not well organized.</p>
<p>Still police right away put in motion plans to move more than 200 officers to the area along with caged Corrections Canada buses (Edwards 2001, 75). The Forest arena was commandeered as an arrest center. Police had also made arrangements with the Canadian military for use of armored personnel carriers. Project Maple was underway. The social war character of the police operation and response to Indigenous occupiers was unescapable. It would soon claim its casualties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Assault on Ipperwash and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday, September 5, and Wednesday, September 6, 1995, dozens of out of town officers appeared in the area near the camp and park. There was a mass mobilization of police force which seemed well out of proportion given the small numbers of community occupiers and the peaceful, by all accounts, nature of the protest.</p>
<p>Police roadblocks were set up on roads around the park and drivers were stopped and questioned. Indigenous drivers and passengers were subjected to particularly lengthy interrogations by police. The night of the police assault police shut down all roads around the park and military base sealing the protesters off from the outside world. Dozens of police vehicles, including containment vans, had been massed outside the park.</p>
<p>Numerous people, like Kettle and Stony Point band councillor Cecil Bernard, told OPP officers during the occupation that the occupiers were “good, peaceful people” (Edwards 2001, 1). They also noted that they felt that the officers did not care or were almost disappointed to hear this.</p>
<p>On the evening of the lethal police raid that killed Dudley George there were only about 25 people inside the park and this included some children (Edwards 2001, 2). The occupiers had no weapons in the park. In fact weapons had been banned by occupiers who realized they could not win in a shootout with police, which they did not seek anyway, and having weapons could be potentially disastrous.</p>
<p>The police maneuvers that resulted in the killing of Dudley George were military in character. The riot squad, the Crowd Management Unit, that moved on the camp was made up of the OPP Tactics and Rescue Unit (TRU) a paramilitary formation (Edwards 2001, 3). They consisted of scouts and snipers. It was never quite clear how the decision to send in the TRU was ever arrived at and ordered.</p>
<p>At one point earlier in the evening they had almost claimed a different victim, also unarmed. A TRU sniper had eyed what he believed to be an Indigenous person with a rifle standing at the side of the road. He also saw what he believed to be the reddish glow from a night vision riffle scope. What happened next is chilling. The officer reported into his radio: “CMU [Crowd Management Unit] be advised party on road may have a weapon in his hand. Check CMU person on the road does have a weapon, does have a weapon. Everybody move. Right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, everybody quick right. Left” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 3). The sniper dropped into position taking aim on the figure, awaiting the order to “Fire.” The man was that close to being dead. As automatic weapons trained on him snipers confirmed the perceived threat. A police scout: “Confirm one man with weapon—long gun” (Edwards 2001, 3). That close.</p>
<p>But the police were mistaken. A message from Constable Mark Beauchene to Acting Sergeant Ken Deane clarified that the man in the crosshairs did not actually have a gun at all. He carried a walking stick. The red glow from the night sight—a lit cigarette (Edwards 2001, 3). And he was that close to being killed right then and there. Under eerily similar circumstances of police error and confusion Dudley George would not escape with such fortune.</p>
<p>Still the CMU continued their ill advised march on the camp. Near the park entrance protesters would see about 30 of them marching toward them in a tight box formation. Years before concerns would be more constantly raised about the militarization of policing, this formation of the riot squad came forward in head to toe body armor, with shin and elbow pads, holding Plexiglas shields and steel batons. They wore heavy helmets not meant to communicate with those they were approaching (to serve and protect of course). Rather their intended communications were only with each other. The helmets were equipped with internal microphones.</p>
<p>Police began pounding on the shields with their batons, “shield chatter,” in the tried and true attempt to intimidate, distract, and terrorize. This was nothing less than a military formation on a military maneuver. It was designed to frighten and threaten and, if necessary, to inflict lethal force. It had no other purpose or intent.</p>
<p>In response the protesters were not fully intimidated. Some turned high powered spotlights on the officers. Lights, symbolically, ironically, illuminating a situation from the history of Canadian settler colonialism—the deployment of military force to drive Indigenous people off of their lands. And the protesters were explicit that they recognized and understood this. They responded to the CMU appropriately: “This is our traditional land. Our forefathers were here before you! Get back on the <em>Mayflower</em>! Go back with the Pilgrims” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). And: “You’re stealing our land! Go back to England! Get the fuck off our land!” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). The land reclaimers were justly defiant. They were no aggressive or violent. None of that mattered to police who were impatient to deploy force against the protesters (for reasons not immediately apparent perhaps but politically significant).</p>
<p>Riot squad officers initially made a raid against Indigenous people in the parking lot. Police adopted a spread formation, standing wide apart to look more menacing and to avoid projectiles (Edwards 2001, 5). Moments later the police charged the group again. Indigenous protesters were beaten, at least one into unconsciousness. Later in the attack a dog that was with the protesters would be shot and killed by police. In the end, in addition to Dudley George, 16-year-old Nicholas Cottrelle would also be shot in the volleys of dozens of bullets fired by police at Indigenous protesters. Cecil Slippery George would be beaten almost to death by police. A dog that was with Cottrelle on a bus the youth tried to drive out of danger was also shot and killed.</p>
<p>Ken “Tex” Deane, the officer  who shot and killed Dudley George, was armed with an East German Heckler and Koch submachine gun. It fired 800 rounds a minute. Deane had been on duty for sixteen hours. Another officer, Sergeant George Hebblethwaite, second in command of the riot squad, recognized that George appeared to be holding only a stick (Edwards 2001, 10). Yet, in what would be found in a trial and inquiry after the killing to be unwarranted and unjustifiable use of force, Deane opened fire anyway. Deane hit George with what were the second and third volleys of bullets he fired. The third volley delivered the lethal shot.</p>
<p>Dudley George&#8217;s sister Carolyn and brother Pierre tried  frantically to get their stricken sibling to the local hospital for urgently needed care. They placed him in a car and made a desperate run for the hospital. What played out was an horrific expression of police vengeance and pettiness. Police attempted at every turn to stop the vehicle carrying the badly wounded Dudley George and the frantic effort to save his life saw the vehicle circumvent several would be roadblocks and out-maneuver the police pursuit.  Incredibly they managed to get Dudley to Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital in Strathroy, Ontario. The nightmare did not end when they got there.</p>
<p>Police chose to arrest and detain Pierre George and Carolyn George, who delivered Dudley to the hospital, rather than get the dying man immediate medical attention. Young Nicolas Cottrelle, only 16, who was also shot by police would  himself be charged by police with attempted murder. With 28 blunt force trauma wounds across his body delivered by police, Slippery George was charged with assault. The laying of charges against people who have been violently attacked by police is a standard practice that is all too familiar to people who have engaged in political protests in Canada. It is a practice that has become routine.</p>
<p>Dudley’s brother Pierre and sister Carolyn, who had so desperately tried to save their brother’s life were put in the Strathroy town jail and each charged with attempted murder. Police at the jail refused to answer Pierre George’s repeated requests to find out how Dudley was. Somehow though they knew.</p>
<p>Dudley George suffered fractures of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs on his left side, a cracked collar bone, and had two large fragments of bullets in the subcutaneous soft tissues (Edwards 2001, 20). The young man, a beloved jokester, was declared dead at 12:20 AM on September 7, 1995, at nearby Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, in Strathroy, Ontario.</p>
<p>Anthony O&#8217;Brien George (March 17, 1957–September 7, 1995), known to friends and family as Dudley, was the eighth of ten children born to Geneviève (“Jenny”) Pauline Rogers George and Reg “Nug” (Reginald Ransford) George.</p>
<p>Kettle and Stony Point Chief, Tom Bressette, described the sense of terror inflicted on the community by police. In his words: “Our elders were fleeing the community&#8230;They were afraid the army would come back with the police and kill them” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 22). The history of violence inflicted on the community and the immediate killing of their neighbor Dudley gave them ample reason to feel threatened. As would be revealed in the pubic inquiry held years later the community without fully knowing it perhaps had larger political reasons to be fearful. The government was fully prepared to deploy, indeed desired, police terror against the community to break the occupation.</p>
<p>The morning after the killing of Dudley George, Premier Harris refused to meet with Chief Bressette, Assembly of First Nations head Ovid Mercredi, and Ontario Chief Gord Peters. Harris referred to the occupation as illegal even though senior government ministers knew it was likely fully legal given the existence of burial grounds in the park (Edwards 2001, 118). The claim of Indigenous illegality was a claim Harris would repeat publicly even days later. After the killing the military tried to denigrate Dudley George by suggesting he had an “extreme criminal record” (Edwards 2001, 116). This was in no way accurate. He had one arrest as a youth (in an event for which white youth also involved were never even charged).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racism and Colonialism Continued: Law and Order Conservatism and the Ipperwash Siege</p>
<p>The community members believed early on that Conservative Premier Mike Harris was responsible for the lethal police operation. Harris and his hard Right neoliberal Conservative Party government had only been elected three months before the killing of Dudley George. His government had made clear in their election campaign that they would make poor and working class communities scapegoats for social discontent and economic uncertainty. The suffering of the poor and unemployed would pay for social programs desired by the wealthy (through a massive transfer of social wealth away from services needed by the poorest members of society). They were an openly reactionary force for capital and fierce proponents of a neoliberal austerity agenda and tough on crime politics of repression.</p>
<p>Under the banner of their so-called “Common Sense Revolution” the Harris Tories launched a counter-revolutionary assault against poor people, welfare recipients, unions, students, community groups, and progressives of all types. At one point a year into his term Harris would target even sociologists (who were critical of anti-social government policy) labeling the discipline as “waste in the system” of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>Harris had, as official Opposition leader, made his racist views on Indigenous communities, and common sense, known to a group of business people (his people) at the Elmhurst Resort near Peterborough. According to Harris: “There’s a whole notion of guilt&#8230;because Native people haven’t fully adapted from the reservations [reserves] to being full partners in this economy. We can’t let that guilt preclude us from reaching a common sense solution” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 26). Common sense to Harris was justification for ongoing colonialism. Hs was, on the whole, an agenda of ramped up violence in service of primitive accumulation and renewed conditions for exploitation more favorable to capital (against policies and programs that offered some buffer for the working class and oppressed.</p>
<p>Among the changes introduced early by Premier Harris was the ending of employment equity legislation that would have had employers make plans to hire visible minorities, women, and Indigenous people (Edwards 2001, 26). This was the common sense counter-revolution for Ontario. Notably this agenda would be taken nationally when the revamped Conservative Party under Stephen Harper came to power between 2005 and 2015 with several veterans of Harris’s Common Sense Revolution as ministers in the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>From the start police were aware that they were being watched closely by the Premier’s office and Conservative Party. The first day of the operation Conservative MPP Marcel Beaubien arrived on the scene and was in communication with the government at Queen’s Park. The earliest government meetings expressed an intention to “remove the occupiers ASAP” (Edwards 2001, 80). The Conservative Party had campaigned on a hard law and order platform of zero tolerance for even minor offenses and the quelling of political dissent. The Premier’s office sought to use the excuse of break and enter or property damage to push it law and order agenda and sought signs of weapons.</p>
<p>Conservative MPP Beaubien released a press statement replaying racist claims about a two-tiered justice system that was soft on Natives, compared, again in racist fashion, to non[-Native people who were presented as “law abiding and tax paying citizens” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). The Indigenous community members were described as “irresponsible, law breaking dissidents” despite the fact that the occupation had not been declared illegal by anyone formally or charges prepared (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). These claims played on racist tropes familiar in the history of Canadian colonialism and cultural erasure of Indigenous peoples. To add a further racist plum MPP Beaubien tried to distinguish between “your decent native citizen” and “thugs” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). Another referent from Canadian colonial discourse.</p>
<p>MPPs like Beaubien were ratcheting up tensions and calling on the Premier’s office for a forceful and swift intervention. Pressure was also coming from Conservative Party supporters. A letter from a local lawyer to the government was circulated saying in part: “The Conservative government had a large law and order plank in its platform—I want to see it live up to its election promises and my expectations. I want to see Ipperwash Provincial Park remain in the public domain, and I want the law enforced to see that it does” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). The letter writer raised the clichéd specter of anarchy and showed little regard for the wellbeing of protesters: “The time to act, and act decisively, is now. If people are hurt, so be it—the laws must be enforced to be respected&#8230;.If illegal acts are tolerated, they spread. The end result is anarchy” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). This from a lawyer promoting illegal police action against Indigenous people who, on the basis of the known burial site on the lands were not actually acting illegally (which it turns out the government was aware of). An open call for potential extrajudicial execution of land defenders.</p>
<p>Ironically the statement offered a note that expressed the very situation of the Indigenous community that had waited 50 years to get their land back. It read: “People begin to perceive the government cannot protect them and their interests—they begin to take steps to protect themselves” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). Meant as a threat this actually explained the situation of the land reclaimers who were being targeted for condemnation.</p>
<p>The appeals of the non-Natives and the racist messaging was not lost o the government which agreed with such sentiments. In meetings of the provincial Emergency Planning Committee, notes show clearly that the Conservative government would accept no compromise and would accept nothing, in fact, except the forced removal of the reclaimers. The government would not negotiate. Neither would they consider, incredibly, that the Indigenous people actually had legitimate claims on the lands. This intransigence was in place even as experts informed them that there were no legal grounds for removal of the occupiers. Stunningly, the government’s own files contained proof of the existence of the burial ground inside the park.</p>
<p>The government had already decided to seek an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the Indigenous protesters. This would ban them from making any argument of their case in the courts, excluding them from the process. It was a measure usually reserved for extreme cases (Edwards 2001, 91). Excluded from the hearing they could not argue or provide evidence for their reasons for being on the land. The police were granted the <em>ex parte</em> injunction for four days.</p>
<p>Notes show that the government asked police to remove the protesters and showed frustration that the police did not do so immediately. The government wanted “to be seen as acting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 89). The government even rejected possible assistance from Kettle and Stony Point band chief Tom Bressette. According to notes: “This government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 90).</p>
<p>Racism played an active part in the approach taken by police as well as by government. Protesters reported police hurling racist epithets at them throughout the occupation and police assault on the reclamation camp and saying Dudley George, by name, would “be the first” (Edwards 2001, 86). Police communication suggested that Native occupiers had been drinking even though there was no sign they were drinking and that they had, in fact, said they wanted no drinking among people at the site. According to police transcripts, OPP Superintendent Anthony Parkin said of the land reclaimers: “They’re probably all boozed up. They’ve probably been drinking” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 98). The police also suggested cynically that some occupiers were leaving because they knew trouble was coming. Yet they had actually left because they had school and jobs to go to (Edwards 2001, 98). This fact never occurred to police steeped in colonial racist ideology of unemployed, uneducated, Natives. The police also played on racist constructions of Indigenous people as untrustworthy and crooked. Toward this end the police spread rumors in the local area about native occupiers stealing gas. This was designed to stoke suspicion and anger among local farmers, business people, and town residents.</p>
<p>Police and government documents would show a close relationship between the provincial government and the OPP, even in contravention of law and public policy separating government from policing operations. OPP Commissioner Thomas O’Grady was a member of a joint crisis team that met regularly beginning one month before Dudley George was killed by police. So close was the relationship that the OPP had been nicknamed the “Ontario Political Police” (Edwards 2001, 120). The joint team was viewed as a legitimate vehicle <em>for</em> government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social War Policing and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>In a case that underlines the state-capital nexus in policing, and the police as social war defenders of capital, the police also received an armored personnel carrier directly from the manufacturer, GM Diesel, in the nearby city of London, Ontario. Of note, the factory had a special agreement with the London police to provide it armored vehicles in times of police need. The only conceivable possible need was crowd control and anti-protest maneuvers.</p>
<p>The  infamous Chief of Police for London at the time, one Julian Fantino (known for racial profiling during his time as chief in York, Ontario and for keeping a list of gay men while in London) agreed to loan a vehicle to the OPP for the siege of Ipperwash. Fantino would, several years later, be head of the OPP at the time of the Six Nations occupation at Caledonia, Ontario. There the police would notoriously assault the occupation in violation of the recommendations that arose following the police murder of Dudley George. OPP under Fantino would also protect white supremacists who sought to attack the Six Nations reclamation.</p>
<p>The military nature of the police action was further reinforced with the use of air cover through helicopter flyovers. Occupiers had noted surveillance by low flying police helicopters as well as shoreline patrols by a police boat. The Indigenous land reclaimers were being encircled on land and in the air. And even by water. Around the clock. This was a full on military siege. At the same time they actually consisted of a grand total of nine people, including three children (Edwards 2001, 80). At one point a police helicopter buzzed so low on a picnic of women and children that it blew their food off the table (Edwards 2001, 86).</p>
<p>The OPP made informal requests for help to the Canadian military. OPP were in communication with the military over a plan to outnumber Natives ten to one (rather than the two to one ratio in effect when Dudley George was killed). Unfortunately for their plan available troops were preparing to fight an external imperial battle in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance and Police Spies</p>
<p>As in traditional military operations the state also deployed special ops against the occupiers. At least one spy provided information over a period of time to both CSIS and the OPP. The one identified spy was Jim Moses, a journalist who had contributed to various Indigenous media as well as mainstream outlets like the state broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and its investigative newsmagazine <em>The Fifth Estate</em> (Edwards 2001, 69). CSIS was particularly interested in involvement by or connections with the Mohawk Warrior Society, noted for activism and community defense at Akwesasne and Oka. Moses reported being paid around $2000 by the OPP over almost three years of spying on Indigenous groups. CSIS paid between 400 dollars and 800 dollars per month (Edwards 2001, 69).</p>
<p>Notably, over his period with the Stoney Point occupiers Moses could find and report no wrongdoing by the group. This despite the fact that it would have been beneficial financially for him to do so. Moses went on to stay with the occupiers at the military base. He never saw any guns at the occupation. He regarded Dudley George as a joker rather than a fighter or leader (Edwards 2001, 70). He expressed deep sadness at George’s killing. In his words: “Dudley was a happy-go-lucky friendly guy&#8230;I was sick. I felt empty&#8230;It was totally unnecessary” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 70). This from the police infiltrator.</p>
<p>The OPP also used officers posing as tourists to spy on Indigenous people along the park beach. In addition two undercover officers were placed in the camp posing as campers. They operated out of a trailer and a mobile home (Edwards 2001, 70). Notably they too had nothing threatening or ominous to report about the activities of the occupiers.</p>
<p>The OPP’s military Tactics and Rescue Unit had been formed specifically to address terrorism (in the period before 9/11). It’s deployment and dubious use in this situation show both the government view of Indigenous land defense and the misuse for purely politically opportunistic purposes various “anti-terror” mechanisms. Notably the police construction of Indigenous land defenders as terrorists continues in recent surveillance and response to Indigenous pipeline resistance in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The police, despite massive surveillance and  an infiltrator in the occupation camp, had no evidence, at any point, of any danger posed by the land reclaimers.  Yet the government took the extreme measure of gaining an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the occupiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Inquiry and a Killer Cop Convicted</p>
<p>In a rare turn of events in the Canadian state context, where police are almost never charged or brought to trial for killing civilian, the officer who killed Dudley George, Acting Sergeant Ken “Tex” Deane was actually charged and his case tried in a court of law. Deane put forward a defense that he believed Dudley George to be carrying a rifle at the time he shot the young man. The presiding judge did not accept this Defense and found Deane’s claims to lack credibility, a rare conclusion regarding police officer testimony in cases where officers are charged for killing someone. According to Judge Hugh Fraser: “I find, sir, that you were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Ontario Provincial Police investigators. You were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Special Investigations Unit of the Province of Ontario. You were not honest in maintaining this ruse before this court” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 198). Deane was found guilty of criminal negligence but sentenced to a non-custodial punishment. For killing Dudley George in cold blood Tex Deane was given a conditional sentence of two years less a day which was to be served in the community (Edwards 2001, 214).</p>
<p>Despite the conviction, Tex Deane did not lose his job as a police officer. He maintained his employment with the force for five-and-a-half years following the criminal conviction. Over that time Officer Deane appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal and eventually all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Finally, in the wake of a hearing under the Police Act, Deane was additionally convicted of Discreditable Conduct. He was given the option of resigning within seven days or being fired and left the force. Deane would go on to work as a security guard, unsettlingly, at an Ontario Hydro nuclear station.</p>
<p>Tex Deane was killed in a car accident on February 25, 2006. Ironically perhaps, his vehicle collided with a truck near Prescott, Ontario while Deane was traveling to testify in the provincial inquiry called into the government handling of the Ipperwash crisis (Harris 2006).</p>
<p>Following the police killing of Dudley George the George family made ongoing calls for both the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to strike a public inquiry into the handling of the response to the land reclamation at Ipperwash by the province and the police. They wanted to know especially the nature and extent of government involvement in directing police operations against the Indigenous community protesters.</p>
<p>Finally, on November 12, 2003, a public inquiry was launched in Ontario. This only happened after the ruling Conservative Party lost the election of 2003 to the Liberal Party headed by Dalton McGuinty. The Conservatives had held to power and refused an inquiry into their actions for eight years.</p>
<p>While the inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario it was carried out under a third party, Sidney B. Linden, who was deemed to be neutral. Linden derived his authority as a commissioner as covered by the Public Inquiries Act (Ontario). The public inquiry was given the specific mandate to examine and report on the events surrounding the killing of Dudley George. This was not a trial and no punishment would be levied. It was expected that the inquiry would provide recommendations covering interactions between police and Indigenous communities in future events of similar nature to the Ipperwash protests.</p>
<p>Evidence provided over the course of the inquiry was damning of the Conservative government’s racism and contempt for Indigenous communities. It also showed dubious government relationships with police and pointed to government pressures on policing in the nature of a police state. At one point a 17-minute tape recording was submitted that revealed a stunning conversation between OPP Inspector Ron Fox and Inspector John Carson, the OPP commander in charge of the Ipperwash case before Dudley George was killed. The two officers discussed Premier Mike Harris&#8217;s aggressive and racist perspective that that the government has “tried to pacify and pander to these people far too long” and to use “swift affirmative action” to remove the Indigenous people from the park (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). It could be said that this was the only time in his period in office that Mike Harris supported any form of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Perhaps most damning was shocking evidence provided by former Ontario Provincial Attorney General Charles Harnick on November 28, 2005. Harniick testified that Premier Harris used extreme profanity while shouting, “I want the fucking Indians out of my park” (Ipperwash Public Inquiry 2005).</p>
<p>Former Premier Mike Harris did appear reluctantly before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. Harris denied in his testimony that he had ever made the statement attributed to him by Harnick (CBC News 2006). Notably, Justice Linden “found the statements were made and they were racist, whether intended or not” (Ipperwash Inquiry, Volume 1 2007, 677).</p>
<p>The evidentiary hearings portion of the inquiry ended on June 28, 2006. The final report from Justice Linden and the overall findings of the inquiry were released on May 31, 2007 (CBC News 2007). They concluded that the Premier’s office and the police had acted inappropriately and improperly in the events at Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not in Vain: Victory to the Occupiers and the Return of the Lands</p>
<p>The killing of Dudley George can only be considered a state atrocity, an extrajudicial execution carried out on behalf of a government that sought to show it was tough of protesters and, more, an upholder of the colonial power relations at the heart of the Canadian state. But Dudley George’s death was not in vain. His people would emerge victorious in this particular struggle despite the efforts of the Ontario government. Unfortunately this victory, and confirmation of the rightness of their struggle, would only come 12 years after Dudley George was killed.</p>
<p>On December 20, 2007, the Ontario Provincial government, now under Liberal Party direction, made a public announcement that it would finally return the full acreage of Ipperwash Provincial Park to its proper inhabitants, the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (Gillespie 2007). This initial announcement did not make full return of the lands immediately since the land was placed under co-management by the provincial government and the Indigenous communities for an unspecified period of time. The government also announced that there would be consultations carried out with nearby local communities (non-Indigenous). Then-Aboriginal Affairs Minister Michael Bryant suggested that the land would be turned over to full Chippewa control at the end of this consultation process.</p>
<p>The date finally came on Thursday May 28, 2009, when then-Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid formally signed control of Ipperwash Park over to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (McCaffery 2009). The full settlement was only finalized on April 14, 2016, a delay for the community of more than 70 years after the government’s promised return of the end of World War Two. The land was turned over to the community along with a  payment of $95 million. The Federal government was represented in the signing over by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan and Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Dr. Carolyn Bennett. Signing the agreement on behalf of the First Nation was Chief Thomas Bressette (Bridge 2016).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some members of the community have opposed the agreement as too little too late. Pierre George was engulfed in flames during a protest prior to the signing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CODA: They are the Government. We Can Never Trust the Police</p>
<p>Peter Edwards gives a sense of the hegemonic view of policing held by most media members, but which Indigenous communities hold with skepticism. According to the reporter:</p>
<p>“It’s a basic understanding in a democracy that police keep a professional distance from politicians It has to be this way. Otherwise, police would soon find themselves ordered to crack down on the political rivals of whoever is in office, ass happens in Third World police states. That would be the certain death of democracy.” (Edwards 2001, 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well then democracy in Canada is already dead. Killed by police. As each of the cases of activists killed by police in Canada shows the ruling politicians and political parties do not keep a distance from police. Regularly they engage with, direct, and/or pressure police to act with violence <em>for political purposes</em> and <em>toward political ends</em>. The police killing of Dudley George was no different in this respect.</p>
<p>One Indigenous woman offered an alternative view of the hegemonic perspective on [police as peacekeepers. In her view: “They [the police] are the government. We can never trust the police” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 25). This is a clear sighted and correct criminological analysis of the historic and contemporary character of policing in Canada. Despite what the national mythologies might have one believe.</p>

2020-05-27,619_CRAP,2020-05-27,,,ON,Toronto,,Unspecified,,Regis,,Korchinski-Paquet,,29.0,Female,Other,,,,Fall,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention;    The death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Indigenous-Ukrainian-Black Canadian woman, occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on May 27, 2020. Responding to multiple 911 calls from Korchinski-Paquet, her mother, and her brother, for a domestic disturbance involving punches, thrown bottles, and knives, police attended her apartment. Subsequent to the arrival of police, Korchinski-Paquet fell to the ground 24 storeys below, and died at the scene.[3] Her family accused the Toronto Police Service of having played a role in her death, which led to a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) investigation. The SIU announced in late August 2020 it had cleared all police officers of wrongdoing and found no evidence of police involvement in her death.       <p>Family members and witnesses have reported that Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Black woman, was killed by being shoved off an apartment balcony by Toronto police on the evening of May 27, 2020. They also report that there was interference by police in preventing them from getting their story to mass media.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario is examining the case. According to the SIU, police claim they were called to an apartment building near High Park Avenue and Bloor Street West, at around 5:15 PM. The SIU say that when officers entered a unit on the 24th floor, “A short time later, the woman fell from the balcony to the ground below.”</p>
<p>Witnesses, including the victim’s mother, say that this is not what happened and that Regis Korchinski-Paquet was shoved by officers. Witnesses also claim that her body was left on the ground below for a substantial amount of time. We know in case after case of police killings of civilians that the word of police when they kill is to be treated with the highest degree of skepticism. Families who have had to suffer the brutality of seeing a loved one killed by police need to be listened to and believed.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned two investigators and two forensic investigators to the killing.</p>

2015-11-07,614_CRAP,2015-11-07,,,ON,Toronto,,Unspecified,,Rodrigo,,Almonacid,,43.0,,,,,,Persons who died IN police custody,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>On November 7, 2017, Rodrigo Hector Almonacid Gonzalez, a hospital worker and father of two young sons, died from injuries sustained in an interaction with Toronto police. Less than a day before more than ten Toronto Police officers, including a tactical squad equipped with a battering ram and shields, had forced their way into the Gonzalez home where the 43 year old occupant had apparently locked himself in his bathroom for reasons yet unknown. During the police encounter two Tasers were deployed against Gonzalez and he was taken from the building on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Photographs taken by Gonzalez’s wife at the hospital reveal horrific injuries including a bloody head injury, a black eye, bruising on an arm and shoulder, and what the family believes to be a Taser mark near the victim’s groin. The family was notified that Gonzalez had internal bleeding shortly before he succumbed to his injuries. His mother and wife reported than he had no injuries before police arrived. They also reported being kept from entering the apartment by police officers.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, despite the injuries sustained by the victim in his encounter with police and despite his death in hospital the next day, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), tasked with investigating all such incidents of police involved civilian harm, took five days before showing up at the apartment to investigate. The family was not told to preserve the scene in the bathroom where the encounter is believed to have occurred and it is not clear if essential evidence has been lost as a result. SIU should have attended and secured the scene directly once it was reported.</p>
<p>Toronto police have refused to comment on the case but an SIU spokesperson confirmed that police reported the incident the day it happened and notified the SIU when Gonzalez died the next day. No answer has been given by SIU for why it took their investigators four days to contact the family. Three SIU investigators and one forensic investigator have since been assigned to the case.</p>

On Sunday, August 6, police responded to the Belvedere LRT Station and “dealt with” three people who were allegedly intoxicated. A 55-year-old woman was arrested and taken into custody, being placed in a holding cell with other people at city police headquarters. She had initially been taken to the northeast division facility before being taken to police headquarters, but no explanation has been provided for why that move was made. Around 10 AM the next morning the woman was found unresponsive and in medical distress on the floor of the cell.

<p>The two RCMP officers who were charged in the shooting and killing and Clayton Crawford in 2018 have been charged with manslaughter. The killer cops, with the Whitecourt RCMP detachment in northern Alberta, had been arrested on June 5 and originally charged with one count each of criminal negligence causing death. Thirty-one-year-old Clayton Crawford was killed by multiple gunshot wounds while inside a car on July 3, 2018.</p>



<p>According to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service transferred responsibility for the prosecution to the Ontario Ministry of Attorney General. ASIRT reports:</p>



<p>“After consultation with the Ontario Crown, on Sept. 3, 2020, a replacement information was sworn jointly charging both officers with the offence of manslaughter. The original information charging both officers with criminal negligence causing death was withdrawn at the request of the Crown.&#8221;</p>



<p>Crawford had fled an attack on the residence at which he was staying and was sleeping in a vehicle at a rest stop when police approached him. ASIRT reports that the officers knew they only looking for a witness or possible victim when they found the man sleeping in the vehicle. Despite this, according to ASIRT, both officers fired their weapons, one fired a service pistol while the other fired a carbine rifle, killing Crawford.</p>



<p>According to ASIRT executive director Susan Hughson, this is the first time in the agency’s history that police shooting and killing someone has led to criminal charges against officers.</p>

The pursuit started at around 8 PM on the evening of Monday, July 3, 2017 near 170<sup>th</sup> Street and 87<sup>th</sup> Avenue. Police apparently pursued the vehicle, a truck, west out of the city in the Winterburn Road area of the city. The truck is said to have collided head-on with a car on the exit ramp from Anthony Henday Drive southbound leading to Whitemud Drive westbound. The man driving the car died at the scene. A female passenger in the car was taken to hospital and suffers life-threatening injuries. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating.</p>
       <p>Romeo Wesley, a 34-year-old Indigenous man of Cat Lake First Nation was killed by police on September 9, 2010, while in police custody at the Cat Lake nursing station. Two Nishnawbe-Aski police officers, Constable Troy Sousa and Constable Chris Carson, pepper sprayed Wesley, beat him with a baton, handcuffed him, and then stepped on his neck and back with their boots after he was face down on the ground and under their control.</p>
<p>This stunning violence is captured in 45 minutes of security video footage from the Health Canada nursing station where Wesley was killed and was shown during the inquest into Wesley’s killing which has finally gotten under way in July 2017. The video shows that several minutes passed from the time that Wesley stopped moving before anyone checked his vital signs. Instead, police took photos of the subdued man and a nurse mopped the floor around him. Dr. Harriet Lennox, the doctor on duty that night, testified that the pepper spray used by police in the confined space made it difficult for the nurses to breathe.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station,  the community’s only health facility, three times over the course of two days, trying to get help for a variety of problems including vision troubles and problems breathing. Instead of help he was killed.</p>
<p>Constable Chris Carson showed up at the scene wearing a t-shirt with a rifle on it. He later took off the shirt and was bare chested when he stood on Romeo Wesley’s neck. Dr. Lennox testified that she wondered when police would consider Wesley to be subdued enough that she could provide medical care, but assumed that they would have proper protocols in place.</p>
<p>The autopsy report of the killing blurred lines on the police violence inflicted on the man and his recurring health problems. It concluded that Wesley died from a combination of “chest compression with prone positional restraint” (police standing on his neck and back) and “severe alcohol withdrawal” which certainly did not naturally lead to being stomped by police boots.</p>
<p>Officers with the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service receive the same training as other police officers in Ontario but they are not subject to Ontario’s Police Service Act and are not subject to the same oversight when people are harmed in their custody.</p>

Luimes was driving at almost 120 kilometers per hour at the time of the collision.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2018, a fatality inquiry into the killing, under provincial court judge Carrie Sharpe, released its recommendations. They call for longer probation periods for new police officers in Alberta. The inquiry suggests that police agencies should institute a probationary period of three months, six months, and one year to evaluate the driving habits of new recruits on an ongoing basis. It also called for removal of any officer where performance or safety concerns are identified by supervisors.</p>
<p>After the killing, Luimes was charged with dangerous driving causing death but a judge decided there was not enough evidence to convict him. The state protects the state in such cases. At a disciplinary hearing Luimes was found guilty of discreditable conduct in the crash. Edmonton police Superintendent Brad Doucette and the investigating officer for the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) were the only witnesses to testify at the inquiry on March 14, 2017. As a result an inquiry scheduled for two days was completed in fewer than three hours.</p>
<p>Killer cop Luimes is still employed by the Edmonton Police Service but longer works on the streets. The state protects the state and killer cops maintain their employment.</p>
       *<p>A disturbingly high number of civilians in Canada are killed by police officers who are speeding or driving recklessly. In most of those cases they are doing so without cause even on their own broad terms. Such was the case on March 8, 2012 when a speeding Constable Chris Luimes crashed his vehicle into a car driven by 84-year-old Annie Walden, killing her. This assessment comes from a senior officer, Brad Doucette, testifying at a fatality inquiry into the killing of Annie Walden which took place on March 14, 2017, an incredible five years after the fact. The inquiry which was scheduled for two days was completed in under three hours. Only two witnesses were called.</p>
<p>Constable Luimes was driving an unmarked police car at nearly 120 kilometers an hour to what was a non-emergency call. The speed limit on the road on which he was traveling was only 50 km/h. His car smashed into the Volkswagen Jetta driven by Annie Walden on 75th Street turning onto 76th Avenue. Walden died at the scene</p>
<p>Of course a civilian traveling at a rate of speed so much over the limit would be dealt with harshly. Let alone the response if they actually killed someone while doing so. Such is not the case where police speed and/or drive recklessly and kill a civilian. Luimes was charged with dangerous driving but once again a judge moved to ensure the killer officer would be taken good care of. The judge, stunningly, ruled that there was no enough evidence to convict the officer, despite a woman killed by his actions and the fact that he had no justifiable reason for driving the way he did, even by the low police department standards of the day.</p>
<p>One week ago, Luimes was found guilty of discreditable conduct in the incident during a police disciplinary hearing. Incredibly, the outcome was that he was ordered to participate in a video that will be used as part of mandatory police training. Constable Luimes still works with the Edmonton police force.</p>

Members of the Saskatoon Police Service took him to the northwest section of the city and abandoned him in a field on a night when temperatures were below −28 °C (−18 °F).[1] The practice is known as a starlight tour, and a number of such cases in the Saskatoon area have been referred to collectively as the Saskatoon freezing deaths.[1] Contents      1 Background     2 Death     3 Inquiry     4 Aftermath     5 In media     6 Notes     7 External links  Background  Stonechild was an accomplished wrestler,[2] having won a bantamweight provincial title in Saskatchewan. Death  Stonechild's friend Jason Roy was with Stonechild the night of his death. When first interviewed by the police in 1990, 5 days after Stonechild's disappearance, Roy provided a handwritten, signed statement stating that he and Stonechild had drunk most of a 40-ounce bottle of vodka between them. Roy also stated that he and Stonechild had parted company at ""about 1130 pm"", and that he had ""blacked out"" and had no recollection of what happened after he and Stonechild separated that night. In 2000, however, Roy stated that the last time he saw Stonechild alive, Stonechild was handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser ""gushing blood"" from a cut on his face, and that the last words Stonechild said to him were ""Jay, help me. They're going to kill me."" [1] Jason Roy's family was ultimately put into an RCMP witness protection program.[1]  Roy also stated that he had given the police officers a false name – Tracy Lee Horse – when they questioned him.[3] Shortly after talking to Jason Roy, Constables Brad Senger and Larry Hartwig encountered Neil Stonechild's cousin, Bruce Genaille, and questioned him on suspicion that he was Stonechild. In 2003, Genaille told the inquiry that there had been nobody in the back of the cruiser at the time.[3]  At 11:56 p.m. on November 24, 1990, Constable Brad Senger performed a query on the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) computer system for the names ""Tracy Horse"" and Tracy Lee Horse"", the false name provided by Jason Roy. Three minutes later, at 11:59 p.m., Constable Senger performed a CPIC query for the name ""Neil Stonechild"". Five minutes later, at 12:04 a.m., November 25, 1990, Constable Hartwig conducted a CPIC query of the name ""Bruce Genaille"". Genaille testified at the Wright inquiry that there had been nobody in the back of the cruiser when Hartwig and Senger questioned him.[3]  His body was found, with one shoe missing, on November 29 by two construction workers. In the initial investigation of his death, the Saskatoon police determined that there was no foul play. Ten years later, however, his companion on November 24/25, Jason Roy, said Stonechild had been in police custody. Roy said he had seen his friend in the back of a police cruiser. In 2000 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated Stonechild's death and the deaths of other First Nations individuals thought to have been in police custody.[3] Inquiry  In 2003, the Saskatchewan provincial government held a Commission of Inquiry (the Wright Inquiry) into Stonechild's death. The report concluded that Stonechild had been picked up by the police shortly before he died on the outskirts of the city. The inquest reported that the officers did not record the interaction in their log books.[4] It concluded that marks on Stonechild's wrists and on his nose could have been caused by handcuffs.[4] The report also concluded that relations between the police and First Nations are problematic. However, the inquiry found that at the time of the death the police investigation was not adequate to conclude what the circumstances were surrounding Neil Stonechild's death.[1] The inquiry concluded on May 19, 2004.[3]  Following the inquest, police officers Larry Hartwig and Brad Senger were fired.[4][5] It was appealed but the firings were upheld.[4][5] Aftermath  In 2015, author Candis McLean published ""When Police Become Prey: The Cold Hard Facts of Neil Stonechild's Freezing Death"", which sought to exonerate Hartwig and Senger; a book signing that would have coincided with the 25th anniversary of Stonechild's death was cancelled.[4] ",Saskatoon Police Service,,,,Neil Stonechild,la CRAP (2021),Yes,3.0,,,None,MR_1,Other,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Stonechild,,

Family members are calling for answers into what happened during the arrest and why there appear to be discrepancies in what police reported and what doctors in the hospital emergency have said.</p>
<p>Randy Cochrane’s cousin Monica Murdock asks pointedly:</p>
<p>“My family’s devastated. We want to know what happened to him. Why did he die in cuffs? Why were they chasing him? Why are they saying he was bloody but the doctors we went and saw at the emergency room last night said that he had no injuries? (quoted in Grabish 2019)</p>
<p>Murdock reports that doctors at the Health Sciences Centre told her family on Sunday, after Cochrane died, that the young man had suffered a heart attack and had a high fever. She also reports that they told her there were no other injuries on his body. She says that doctors informed her that it was too late by the time Cochrane arrived at the hospital at 4:30 PM because he had been without a pulse for some time (Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>Murdock describes her cousin as “a fierce protector of his family” and she says “he was more like a brother to her” (2019). She relates fondly: “He always made sure we were protected. We were safe. The last time I saw him he came to my house and he gave me some money for my baby ‘cause my daughter’s in the hospital” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>Marjorie Cochrane raised Randy after adopting him. She remembers:</p>
<p>“He was really always close to his daughters. It’s hard. Taking it hard” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>She too has important questions for police: “What happened when they handcuffed him?” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>A witness, Will Couture, says Cochrane, rather than being a threat, appeared to be shouting for help while running from something or someone (2019). Couture reports that the man, kept repeating “help me, help me” (Grabish 2019). He then saw police chase Cochrane across the street.</p>
<p>Couture claims that the man looked “freaked out.” In his words: “Just scared. Just like terrified of something you know what I mean? It was like the devil was chasing him” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>If it was the police, he may be completely right in that.</p>

Police allegedly saw a man they believed to be bleeding and armed with a weapon and chased him on foot, catching him not far away. During the arrest the man became unresponsive. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. It has not been conformed publicly that the man was bleeding prior to the arrest.</p>

2016-10-24,1184_CRAP,2016-10-24,,,SK,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Jordan,,Lafond,,21.0,Male,Indigenous,,,,Altercation,,,,,,"Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer;    <p>There are many unanswered questions about the role Saskatoon police played in the death of 21-year-old Jordan Lafond of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation. An inquest into the death that was scheduled to take begin March 5, 2018, and which family hoped would provide some answers, has now been postponed until June 25.</p>
<p>The questions surrounding Lafond’s death are more pressing given that police initially suggested the injuries that led to Lafond’s death were inflicted in a vehicular crash and did not report that an officer used his knee to subdue the young man when he was handcuffed.</p>
<p>It has been reported publicly that Jordan Lafond died after the stolen truck he was a passenger in crashed into a fence on the outskirts of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the early morning hours of October 23, 2016. Lafond was taken into custody and later died in hospital. Police have not been forthcoming on their role in Lafond’s death and what they did to him during the arrest.</p>
<p>A six-person jury, five women and one-man, was selected on Monday. Four of the jurors are Indigenous. Three were selected from a special jury pool of Indigenous people and one who self-identified. The request for Indigenous jurors can be made at inquests but not for criminal trials, an issue that has received great attention following the recent not guilty verdicts in the killings of Indigenous youth Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine. The inquest is strictly a fact finding exercise and cannot assign blame or lead to charges being laid.</p>
<p>Grace Lafond-Barr, Jordan’s grandmother expressed the family’s grief: “Emotions have been up and down. A lot of tears, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness. Because we don’t know what happened to Jordan” (quoted in Hamilton 2018). She noted that police were not honest in reporting their actions during Jordan Lafond’s arrest. In her words: “We didn’t hear the truth when we were told of Jordan’s injuries. It would be nice to know what happened to him” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Police changed their story about what happened a few weeks after Lafond died. They had initially claimed that Lafond was found underneath a tire of the truck that crashed and said at that time that he died of injuries resulting from that crash. Then-police Chief Clive Weighill alleged that officers believed Lafond was resisting arrest and acknowledged that an officer used his knee to subdue Lafond and that he was handcuffed. Police have not admitted what part that might have played in the death.</p>
<p>Police even had to downgrade the initial charge of dangerous driving causing death laid against the driver of the stolen truck. Said the Crown prosecutor at the time: “We weren’t in a position to prove that the accident—or the collision, in this case—caused the death” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Saskatoon Police Service released a statement on March 5 saying that  they had carried out an internal investigation into Lafond’s death but would not release any details or results. There is no police oversight body, independent or otherwise, in Saskatchewan. The officer responsible is still on regular duties.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond was a new father and worked at a roofing company to support her. Said Lafond-Barr: “Yes maybe he was in a stolen vehicle. But that doesn’t mean you should end his life over it. That’s what I said. I would like to bring some humanity to this (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Anyone following events in Saskatchewan will note that young Indigenous men have been killed in that province for as little as stepping foot on a farm claimed by a white settler, with the settler farmer getting off despite admitting to the killing. So being killed by police for being in a stolen vehicle would not be unlikely in that context. And the officer involved will likely not even be charged. Jordan Lafond was the same age as Colten Boushie.</p>

       *<p>Jordan Bruce Lafond, a 21-year-old father of a small child, died one day after being taken into custody by Saskatoon police following a violent arrest on October 23, 2016. Several weeks later serious questions remain unanswered regarding the role of police violence in causing the young man’s death.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond’s mother, Charmaine Dreaver is seeking answers to those questions in the face of general silence from Saskatoon police. In her words: “I just want and need the truth to be told,” (quoted in Markewich 2016). Family members have turned to the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations special investigations unit and the Chief of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation to discuss possible steps forward.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond was the passenger in a vehicle that crashed while being chased by police. The driver sustained minimal injuries and ran from the scene. He was later found and charged. Lafond was supposedly found beneath the rear of the vehicle. Police have claimed he was thrown from the vehicle during the crash and was not run over by any vehicle. .</p>
<p>Charmaine Dreaver notes her son showed real physical trauma. In her words: “My son was banged up pretty bad. His body showed signs of a lot of damage” (quoted in Markewich 2016). She has reported being left with a sense of unease and questioning since learning about her son’s injuries. This sense grew upon hearing that the other man in the vehicle who fled was not nearly as badly injured (Markewich 2016). As she recalls: “[That] made me feel that, OK, there’s something more to this” (quoted in Markewich 2016). Police have said that the injuries, including bruising and head trauma were caused by the collision (Markewich 2016). She asked immediately for an autopsy to be undertaken to receive some answers and clarification. She relates: “I was angered and I was so hurt because my son went through so much pain” (quoted in Markewich 2016).</p>
<p>Police have provided the questionable and apparently contradictory explanation that the supposedly fatally injured Lafond resisted arrest to such an extent that an officer felt compelled to use a knee to subdue him. This seems implausible given the supposed degree of injuries police suggest were sustained from the crash alone.</p>
<p>Dreaver finds the explanation questionable as well. She notes: “I almost felt that I was lied to, really, because I didn’t know. I wasn’t told about [it]” (quoted in Markewich 2016).</p>
<p>The autopsy was completed Wednesday, November 2 but results have not been released. Saskatoon Police Chief Clive Weighill has not given the public a timeline for release of the autopsy findings.</p>

       *<p>On October 23, 2016, Jordan Bruce Lafond (21) died after police used physical force to arrest him. The victim was in a vehicle that crashed while chased by police. It is reported that Lafond was thrown from the truck. An officer used a knee to subdue the stricken youth. Lafond was taken to hospital after being arrested. He died there the next day.</p>
<p>An autopsy was carried out Wednesday, November 2, but the Saskatoon Police Service is not saying when details of the autopsy would be available. The Police Service reports there is some video of the incident but they have not released it to the public and claim that it is too dark to make anything out. This has not been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>The investigation into Lafond’s death will be undertaken by the Saskatoon Police Service which gives no sense that it will be a thorough or reliable investigation, as police examine police. Jordan Bruce Lafond’s family, along with the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations special investigations unit, has met with Saskatoon Police Chief Clive Weighill to discuss the incident and investigation. In the meantime the officer involved has been reassigned to administrative duties while the examination is carried out.</p>

       <p>On June 19, 2017, Saskatoon police shot 22-year-old Austin Eaglechief. The young man then crashed the vehicle he was driving into another vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy suggests the gunshot was not the cause of death but it does not speak to the part that being shot played in the fatal crash. A 33-year-old passenger was also injured in the crash. Critics of the police suggest that officers were too quick to shoot the young man. The Saskatoon police force has a history of racist treatment and violence against Indigenous people in the city and nearby locales.</p>

Severight, of the Waywayseecappo First Nation, about 280 kilometers northwest of Winnipeg, was struck by the vehicle driven by Holz while crossing Main Street near Sutherland Avenue around 8 PM. Officer Holz had been out drinking before getting into his vehicle. He has been charged with impaired driving causing death and failing to remain at the scene of an accident.</p>
<p>Two other Winnipeg officers involved in the investigation into Holz’s killing of Severight were placed on administrative leave ten days after the killing.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba (IIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, reported that it had been notified of “irregular and improper conduct of two officers.” The IIU has now concluded that no charges should be laid and reported this in an uninformative media release. IIU director Zane Tessler said in that release: “It’s kind of difficult to discuss the specifics of [my decision] given that everything is intertwined in pending matters that are still before the court.“ Indeed developing excuses for letting cops off the hook can take time and is no doubt “difficult to discuss” in a way that they public would accept.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) may continue its “investigation” into the two officers. Both officers have returned to duty and the WPS says it will not be commenting further. By now we have come to know what to expect when police investigate police.</p>

The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians has concluded that no criminal charges will be brought against an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer in relation to the high speed police chase that resulted in the death of pedestrian Grace Glofcheskie in Guelph, Ontario in 2015. This despite the SIU investigation finding that the officer’s driving was “objectively dangerous” and his vehicle was in excess of 68 km/h over the posted speed limit at times during the chase.</p>
<p>The officer was pursuing an SUV whose driver was attempting to avoid a RIDE (drinking and driving) spot check on December 13, 2015. The chase went through Guelph’s downtown area. At its conclusion the SUV driver lost control, crossing onto a sidewalk and flipping. Grace Glofcheskie, who was walking home after visiting friends, was struck by the SUV. She was taken to hospital but died of her injuries. The SUV was later identified as stolen.</p>
<p>The SIU reported that it had assigned seven investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to the case. Six police officers and six civilians were interviewed for the investigation. The officer being investigated did not participate, nor did he provide a copy of his notes. This is a contentious part of SIU investigations, as police are legally allowed to withhold their notes, one which has been challenged by critics of the SIU and oversight procedures in Ontario.</p>
<p>There are some questions raised by the SIU report. Notably their conclusion not to bring any charges against the officer despite finding that his driving had been “objectively dangerous” in their words and the speeds of more than 68 km/h over the posted speed limit reached by the officer. The SIU explanation is also rather perplexing. It states: “However, the factual context does not allow me to conclude that the driving amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation as the officer would have exercised in the circumstances” (SIU Release). It is hard to see how a civilian driving at such speeds over the posted limit and in an “objectively dangerous” manner would be viewed as so reasonable and would avoid charges. Indeed it is shown time and again that civilian drivers under less dangerous circumstances are charged.</p>

2017-09-25,873_CRAP,2017-09-25,,,ON,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Sheila,,Walsh,,65.0,Female,Unspecified,,,,Other,,,,,,"Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer;    <p>A high speed police chase by members of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) ended in the death of Sheila Walsh (65), who was not the target of the chase. The driver of the pursued vehicle, a pickup truck, crashed into the vehicle being driven by Walsh with the truck bursting into flames. Walsh was declared dead at the scene. After the crash police told neighbors to evacuate their homes because of gasoline spilling out at the scene.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines harm to civilians by police in Ontario, is investigating the high-speed pursuit and how OPP officers responded to the situation. According to the SIU, police claim that at about 3:20 PM on September 25, 2017, the OPP responded to a call about a reportedly stolen vehicle in Eganville, around 130 kilometers west of Ottawa. The 20-year-old driver of the vehicle in question headed toward Arnprior on Highway 60, then to Highway 17, where the OPP began their pursuit. The truck collided with Welsh’s car a bit after 4 PM as she was pulling from her driveway on Daniel Street.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned five investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to investigate the crash and the circumstances leading to it. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed. It is known that the risky and careless police decision to pursue enforcement of property rights has led to the death of a civilian.</p>
<p>One witness put it in clearly sensible term, In the words of Eric Bayley, a Bell Canada worker who observed the chase and crash while working:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The chase should never have happened. If the guy robbed a bank they would have got him sooner or later. It was a stolen vehicle. Big freakin’ deal. Now a poor grandmother, mother, sister is dead. There’s no … way in hell those cops should have been chasing them down that … road.” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continued Bayley:</p>
<p>“There had to have been eight cop cars and three Suburbans wide open going down Daniel Street. It could have been a lot worse. I was talking to my buddy on the phone and I was like, ‘Holy s—t. This is not going to go well.’ He said, ‘What’s going on?’ and I said, ‘There’s a high-speed chase. There’s cruiser after cruiser after cruiser.’” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, a  flag worker on construction site the chase plowed through had to leap to safety.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Police Services Act sets out the rules governing police pursuits. According to the Act, police can pursue or continue pursuit “if the police officer has reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed or is about to be committed; or for the purposes of motor vehicle identification or the identification of an individual in the vehicle.” The Act also further states police must continually weigh whether “the immediate need to apprehend an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle or the need to identify the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle outweighs the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit.” Dispatch must be notified of the pursuit and the (Crawford and Gillis 2017).</p>

       ***<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines case of police harm to civilians in Ontario, has assigned two investigators to look into the circumstances surrounding the death of a woman arrested by Windsor police on September 4, 2017. The woman was taken to the police station before being transported to hospital. She was released the following day but readmitted on September 10.  She ended up on life support under circumstances that have not been explained publicly and was pronounced dead on September 18 after being taken off life support. No further details have been released publicly.</p>
       ***<p>Toronto police constable James Forcillo shot and killed Sammy Yatim in 2013. Forcillo shot Yatim multiple times, firing even after the stricken youth had fallen dead. At the time Forcillo shot Sammy Yatim, the distressed youth was isolated and completely alone on a Toronto streetcar posing no threat to police or the public (as captured on witness video of the killing). For this Forcillo was sentenced in 2016 to six years behind bars, for attempting to kill Yatim (but curiously not for murder). That sentence was a rarity for killer cops in Canada, who are rarely charged and almost never convicted as the state protects the state in such cases.</p>
<p>Forcillo has been out on bail as he appeals the verdict and sentence. On Friday, September 29, 2017, Forcillo was granted a bail extension. A bail extension document states that the appeal process will contain a “fresh evidence phase.” The previous bail conditions for Forcillo were set to expire on Sunday, October 1, 2017, one day before the killer cops is scheduled to appeal his conviction for attempted murder in killing Sammy Yatim. Forcillo will now remain free either until the day before that hearing or until April 2, 2018 (whichever comes first).</p>
<p>Killer cop Forcillo is asking the appeal court to substitute a not-guilty verdict or to  order a new trial in his case. Forcillo, a member of an institution that favors and promotes mandatory minimum sentences, is also seeking a declaration that the mandatory minimum sentence for attempted murder is unconstitutional (erstwhile proponents always want mandatory sentences dropped when they come close to home). Instead Forcillo wants to be granted a suspended sentence. Otherwise he seeks a reduction of his sentence to the minimum five years.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Forcillo’s appeal wishes to have arguments presented arguing for the bogus and discredited “suicide by cop” justification for police killings. This is a piece of propaganda, or copaganda, used to  excuse or legitimize police killings of civilians. It is a mechanism for blaming the victim and removing a killer cop’s responsibility in deciding to shoot and kill someone who may have been in distress, even where they posed no threat to the public or to officers (as in a youth alone in an empty streetcar). It is despicable and nasty ploy by police and their supporters. Unfortunately there are unprincipled “criminologists” for hire (usually active or former cops) who are willing to promote this copaganda in courts to defend killer cops.</p>

       ***<p>Two people, a man and a woman, are dead following a police pursuit on Highway 6, south of Guelph, Ontario, around 10 AM on the morning of October 5, 2017. The car had been pursued by officers of the Waterloo Regional Police. The pursuit started at 9:30 AM. The pursued vehicle then drove east on Highway 401, then turned south onto Highway 6. At about 9:55 AM, roughly 30 KM away from the location at which the officers first tried to intercept the car, the vehicle collided head-on with a transport truck in a devastating crash that destroyed the car and killed its occupants. Both the male driver and the female passenger of the pursued vehicle were pronounced dead at the crash scene. The transport truck driver was not physically injured.</p>

       ***<p>Two people, a man and a woman, are dead following a police pursuit on Highway 6, south of Guelph, Ontario, around 10 AM on the morning of October 5, 2017. The car had been pursued by officers of the Waterloo Regional Police. The pursuit started at 9:30 AM. The pursued vehicle then drove east on Highway 401, then turned south onto Highway 6. At about 9:55 AM, roughly 30 KM away from the location at which the officers first tried to intercept the car, the vehicle collided head-on with a transport truck in a devastating crash that destroyed the car and killed its occupants. Both the male driver and the female passenger of the pursued vehicle were pronounced dead at the crash scene. The transport truck driver was not physically injured.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines case of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating the chase and crash.  They have not disclosed how many Waterloo Regional Police officers were involved although reportedly at least three police cruisers were at the crash scene.</p>
       <p>Fifteen-year-old Nathan Wehlre from Cambridge, Ontario and 16-year-old Taryn Hewitt of London, Ontario have been publicly identified as the victims of a fatal police chase on October 5, 2017, that ended in a crash described as “devastating” between the car being pursued and a transport truck. Family members have described the two as being in a relationship. The police chase was initiated by officers of the Waterloo Regional Police after a witness saw the couple arguing on the street in Cambridge, Ontario. The crash occurred on Highway 6 between Guelph and Hamilton. The Special Investigations Unit, which examines police harm to civilians, is investigating.</p>

Two Nishnawbe-Aski police officers, Constable Troy Sousa and Constable Chris Carson, pepper sprayed Wesley, beat him with a baton, handcuffed him, and then stepped on his neck and back with their boots after he was face down on the ground and under their control.</p>
<p>This stunning violence is captured in 45 minutes of security video footage from the Health Canada nursing station where Wesley was killed and was shown during the inquest into Wesley’s killing which has finally gotten under way in July 2017. The video shows that several minutes passed from the time that Wesley stopped moving before anyone checked his vital signs. Instead, police took photos of the subdued man and a nurse mopped the floor around him. Dr. Harriet Lennox, the doctor on duty that night, testified that the pepper spray used by police in the confined space made it difficult for the nurses to breathe.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station,  the community’s only health facility, three times over the course of two days, trying to get help for a variety of problems including vision troubles and problems breathing. Instead of help he was killed.</p>
<p>Constable Chris Carson showed up at the scene wearing a t-shirt with a rifle on it. He later took off the shirt and was bare chested when he stood on Romeo Wesley’s neck. Dr. Lennox testified that she wondered when police would consider Wesley to be subdued enough that she could provide medical care, but assumed that they would have proper protocols in place.</p>
<p>The autopsy report of the killing blurred lines on the police violence inflicted on the man and his recurring health problems. It concluded that Wesley died from a combination of “chest compression with prone positional restraint” (police standing on his neck and back) and “severe alcohol withdrawal” which certainly did not naturally lead to being stomped by police boots.</p>
<p>Officers with the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service receive the same training as other police officers in Ontario but they are not subject to Ontario’s Police Service Act and are not subject to the same oversight when people are harmed in their custody.</p>

The Independent Investigations Office spent one week looking into the case before announcing Friday that video evidence ""conclusively"" shows the teenager shot himself, and that he was the only one who opened fire.  Diggle died in hospital on Sunday, three days after sustaining a gunshot wound to his head in a parking lot in Surrey's Fleetwood neighbourhood. A Surrey RCMP officer was on scene responding to a report of a possible robbery in progress, which triggered the IIO investigation.   But the watchdog concluded the teenager's death was ""not the result of any actions or inaction by police.""  The officer was pulling up in a marked SUV when the youth opened fire on the vehicle, according to the IIO's investigation.  ""Before the vehicle came to a stop, the young man fired two shots, both of which struck the front of the police SUV,"" the watchdog said in a news release. ""Immediately after firing at the police vehicle, the video then shows that the youth turned the gun on himself.""  The police watchdog said the officer quickly backed the SUV away from the scene, and that it's ""clear based on the video evidence that at no point does the officer withdraw or discharge their firearm.""  The officer wasn't injured during the encounter.  It's unclear whether an actual robbery took place, but the IIO said it was Diggle who called and filed the police report.  The findings of the investigation raise questions about the teenager's state of mind at the time.  His distraught family previously told CTV News he didn't own a gun, and that they didn't believe he was suicidal. They said the teenager, who recently entered his graduating year of high school, was excited about learning to drive.  On Thursday night, more than 100 people gathered at the parking lot for a vigil marking one week since the teenager was fatally injured.  The circumstances surrounding Diggle's death are still being investigated by Surrey RCMP and the BC Coroners Service.       ***
<p>A man died after being tased by Nass Valley RCMP during an arrest in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks in the evening of October 13, 2020. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm in British Columbia, is examining the death.</p>



<p>The IIO reports that officers from the Nass Valley RCMP detachment went to the 4300 block of Monroe Street in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks right before 8 PM on calls of an altercation between two men who knew each other. Police claim that when officers arrived, one man had already been taken to a local medical clinic for treatment of a stab wound and the other man “was being calmed by neighbours.” Police allege that before the man was arrested, he began harming himself. The police responded with violence, tasing him.</p>



<p>It has been reported that several civilians helped police to take the man not custody. He was then transported to the local clinic in a police vehicle. For some reason BC Emergency Health Services was not readily available according to the RCMP. The man died at the clinic.</p>

2016-06-24,1048_CRAP,2016-06-24,,,BC,Port Alberni,4444 Morton St,V9Y 4M8,,Jocelyn,Marsha,George,,18.0,Female,Indigenous,,,,Unspecified,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention;    <p>In the Canadian context too little attention is given to deaths that occur in police custody. Little is revealed about the circumstances of the deaths and too many questions are left unanswered. This is particularly the case in deaths of Indigenous people in police custody in Canada, occurrences which have been too frequent and too frequently passed over by media and academics alike.</p>
<p>Serious questions remain to be answered regarding the in custody death of Jocelyn Nynah Marsha George (18), a member of the Ahousaht and Hesquiaht First Nations, on the evening of June 24, 2016. The young Indigenous woman died while being held by the RCMP in Port Alberni. She had been arrested on June 23 for uncertain reasons. The BC Coroners Service reported that George was taken to Westcoast General Hospital the next morning “in need of medical attention” of an undisclosed nature. She was then taken by air ambulance to Victoria&#8217;s Royal Jubilee Hospital and died there on the evening of June 24. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), which investigates all incidents of violence by police against civilians in British Columbia, are investigating.</p>
<p>Jocelyn George’s family members want to know why their loved one was left alone in the cell by RCMP and for how long. They also want to know if or when officers checked on her while she was being held. They would also like to see any video footage from the detachment (Zussman 2016b).</p>
<p>The family reports that Jocelyn George was taken into custody for a “disturbance” and was left alone in her cell. This raises real questions about police interactions with indigenous people, particularly indigenous youth. It is well documented that Indigenous people are responded to more punitively by police and are detained disproportionately to non-Natives in Canada (see Monchalin 2016). That Jocelyn George was taken into custody over a disturbance should raise flags about issues of police discretion, possible racism or profiling, and punitive policing.</p>
<p>Doctors at the hospital stated that they found a mix of drugs and alcohol in the teenager’s system which may have damaged internal organs. There is no sense yet why the police did not provide care and attention to someone who may have been experiencing distressed health. The family wants the IIO investigation to place focus on the ways in which police officers treat people dealing with addictions and health issues while in custody (Zussman 2016b). She apparently needed help but did not receive it.</p>
<p>George’s uncle Linus Lucas notes the ongoing impact of state violence and the residential school system on the family. These are the histories of Canadian colonialism and genocide that have devastated Indigenous communities and families and in which the RCMP were, and continue to be, central figures. This further informs questions about the lack of attention, care, or compassion George received while in custody. According to Lucas:</p>
<p>“In some ways I’m saying it’s not surprising where she ended up, given our own family history. Both my parents are survivors of residential schools. You only know how to deal with things in one manner, and that’s get angry and say what the hell is wrong with you, get your act together, and you are yelling..It just got her more determined to say, ‘I don&#8217;t have to deal with you and I will do what I want, just leave me alone,’ and it just got harder and harder for us to deal with.” (quoted in Zussman 2016b)</p>
<p>Two young children, four months and three years old, are left without their mother. She is fondly remembered by family members who recall a sweet girl. According to Christopher Cenmane, the father of her four-month-old daughter: “She was too young to say goodbye. I will always love her. I will always have her living in my heart. She is young, beautiful, smart. She will always be my love” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Incredibly, but in manner too common in cases of police involved deaths of civilians, the family was not even notified by police that their loved one had been taken to hospital. The family reports that they would not have known at all about the situation if an Indigenous hospital worker had not called to tell them (Zussman 2016b).</p>
<p>In the words of the victim’s cousin Lee Lucas: “We know she was brought in and they said she was okay, and she was found in the morning. Our main concern is to find out what happened in the time between when she was arrested and when the ambulance picked her up” (quoted in Zussman 2016a).</p>
<p>The family hopes the investigation will address police protocols for interacting with people dealing with addictions and/or health care issues. According to Lee Lucas: “If things can change from this, if cop protocols can change from this when they bring someone in who has issues like this&#8230;You have got to look at how they are brought in and why they are not checked out” (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Again questions remain to be asked why police are taking custody of people in health crises and why alternative care and support are not made available rather than police and detention. And why are police allowed to impose penalty and punishment in these cases in any event?</p>
<p>Jocelyn George’s cousin further points out that such punitive policing is especially deployed against Indigenous people and it is taking a brutal toll. In her words: “Sometimes things have to change because this is happening far too much especially for our people in this province” (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Change must come and directly.</p>
<p>Anyone waiting for or expecting answers or police accountability from the IIO are likely to be disappointed. The agency, which has a connection with training through the Justice Institute of BC police academy has taken exceedingly long times to complete investigations and does not have a good record of finding against police involved in civilian deaths in the province.</p>

2019-03-13,1050_CRAP,2019-03-13,,,BC,Kamloops,560 Battle St,V2C 6N4,,Randy,,Lampreau,,49.0,Male,Indigenous,,,,Other,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention      B.C.’s police watchdog has cleared Kamloops Mounties of any wrongdoing following the death of a man held overnight in the detachment’s holding cells in March.  Randy Lampreau, 49, died on the morning of March 13 from a health condition, but the actions of police during his time in custody fell within the standard of care expected, according to a report from the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. (IIO BC) released Thursday.  IIO representatives shared those findings with members of Lampreau’s family at a downtown Kamloops hotel on Thursday afternoon.  Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Lampreau’s sister-in-law, Lenora Starr, said the family is “dissatisfied” with the RCMP’s policies and procedures for the types of situations in which her brother found himself and would like to see them addressed, particularly by finding better ways to care for intoxicated individuals rather than putting them in jail. As a family, we’re going to do everything we can to make Randy’s passing not be for nothing,” Starr said. “We want to prevent other families from having to go through what we’ve gone through.”  Lampreau’s brother, Arnie Lampreau, said he thinks it’s clear his brother didn’t receive proper care.  “I think my brother, if he had the proper assessment, he should be alive today,” Arnie Lampreau said.  IIO chief civilian director Ronald MacDonald told reporters there was no use of force by police, describing interactions between the RCMP and Lampreau as “fairly co-operative.”  “The steps taken while in the cells to conduct regular checks was all done in accordance with appropriate practice,” MacDonald said. “Unfortunately, near the end of the evening, he suffered from a life-threatening condition … and some influence of the presence of drugs in his system, which caused his death.”  Lampreau’s autopsy showed he died from inflammation of the heart, with the level of methamphetamine in his system acting as another “significant contributing factor” in his death. It also showed he didn’t sustain any significant injuries that would have caused his death.  The IIO had no concerns regarding police action or inaction during Lampreau’s time in custody, which was captured entirely by video surveillance during his arrest, through the booking process and inside the detachment’s cells, the watchdog’s report stated.  Kamloops Mounties responded to a complaint from a business in the 100-block of Victoria Street downtown at 9:30 p.m. on March 12. The complaint concerned an apparently intoxicated man remaining at the business after he was asked to leave. Police arrived and found Lampreau in a nearby parking lot, where he was arrested under the Liquor Control and Licensing Act and taken to RCMP cells, to be released when he was able to care for himself.  In video from the booking area, Lampreau seemed to sway and stumble, with officers steadying him on several occasions to prevent him from falling, according to the IIO report.  Lampreau then walked with officers to a cell and was left sitting on the floor in the corner.  A civilian cell guard told the IIO he checked on Lampreau and other occupants regularly through the night.  When roused, Lampreau indicated “he was good” and asked when he could leave, to which the guard told him “not yet,” as he still appeared intoxicated.  While monitoring cell video, at about 1 a.m., the guard saw Lampreau fall backwards onto the floor and went check on him. He said he was reassured Lampreau hadn’t hurt himself.  Lampreau was roused again at about 2 a.m. and seemed fine, the guard recalled.  By about 3 a.m. Lampreau lay down and the guard assumed he was “sleeping it off.”  The guard said he did checks every 15 minutes — as required — either via video monitor or through the cell window, noting Lampreau appeared to be breathing or otherwise moving slightly.  However, shortly before 6 a.m., the guard said he noticed Lampreau hadn’t moved for some time, so he went to check on him.  The guard said he noticed Lampreau’s “colour wasn’t right” and it appeared there was a small amount of liquid coming from his mouth. The guard called an RCMP officer, who then called in paramedics, who were said to have arrived quickly.  Lampreau was pronounced dead shortly after they arrived  The IIO report stated the guard’s account of what happened was corroborated by the cellblock log book and video evidence.  MacDonald said this death raises the question of whether jail cells are the appropriate place to house intoxicated individuals.  “I think it’s a question that needs to be addressed right across the country,” MacDonald said, noting he has spoken to police agencies that share his belief that it’s not the appropriate setting.  MacDonald said it’s standard practice for police to hold intoxicated individuals in cells until they sober up and conduct regular checks.  “But those are done by, essentially, lay persons who don’t have medical training in most cases,” said MacDonald.  Starr said the family challenged the IIO to go above and beyond mere letters of support and to keep in touch with them regarding what else they can do to help address the issue of intoxicated individuals dying in police cells. She said they will also be speaking to the BC Coroners Service and will be seeking an inquest into RCMP policies and procedures.  “It’s going to be a bit of a process. It’s a long road for the family, but we want to make sure that there’s something good that will come from this for other families and individuals that are in similar situations,” said Starr.  In light of the death, the BC Civil Liberties Association is reiterating its call for the province to add more sobering centres throughout B.C. Members of Kamloops council have also expressed support for the establishment of sobering centres in the city.  While he can’t say if the availability of a sobering centre would have changed Lampreau’s fate, MacDonald said it is an alternative worth considering.",RCMP,,,,Randy Lampreau,la CRAP (2021),Added,3.0,,,None,None,,,,https://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/news/kamloops-rcmp-cleared-in-march-death-of-man-in-detachment-cell-1.23896884

Everett Patrick was taken off life support on Friday and died early Monday morning at the Prince George hospital, according to his sister Miranda Thomas.   The Independent Investigations Office of B.C., which is responsible for investigating police-related incidents of death or serious harm, would not confirm Patrick's identity but said its team is investigating to determine what role, if any, the RCMP's actions or inaction may have played in his death.  Patrick was hospitalized on April 12 after being taken into police custody and went into ""medical distress,"" according details from the police watchdog organization.   Thomas said the grief of the situation has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant most family members couldn't be in hospital with him during his final days.   She said many of her final hours at the hospital were spent video-calling family so they could see and talk to Patrick.   ""Letting him go was really hard,"" she said.   Everett Patrick, a member of the Lake Babine Nation, was 42.         <p>Everett Patrick (42), a member of the Lake Babine First Nation, has died after being taken into custody by Prince George RCMP on April 12, 2020. Patrick had been hospitalized after going into “medical distress” while being arrested by RCMP. He was taken off life support on April 17 and died on April 20.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating Patrick’s death. They report that the RCMP used a dog team to track Patrick down after allegedly responding to an alarm at a private business. They also say that Patrick was taken to hospital twice on the day he was arrested, first to be treated for what have been described as “minor wounds.” The nature of these wounds has not been confirmed publicly but it has been said that they were bites from the police dogs.</p>
<p>The IIO report that hours after being returned to the RCMP detachment from the hospital, Patrick “went into medical distress and was transported to hospital where he was found to be suffering from serious injury.” Miranda Thomas, Patrick’s sister, says that the family has been told that “he was having a seizure in the jail cell” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>Thomas says that doctors told the family that a CT scan showed that Patrick suffered “bleeding in his brain requiring emergency surgery and that he wasn&#8217;t expected to survive” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>The family has serious questions about what happened to Patrick while he was in RCMP custody and what caused him to be taken to the hospital for a second time the same day (Bellrichard 2020).</p>

The IIO reports that three officers responded to a call of a man walking outside a restaurant carrying a knife in the city’s Norwell Drive area. Notably, the IIO reports that the caller said the man did not appear to be threatening anyone.</p>
<p>The report says one officer first encountered Ford on Country Club Drive, behind St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and he was allegedly  “walking purposefully” (though it is not explained what this meant exactly A second officer then arrived in a car. As Ford began walking towards the vehicle the officer shot Ford twice. There is nothing in the report to suggest how an officer inside a police vehicle was under any threat from a man allegedly holding a knife and nothing more. There is some hint in the report that police were attempting to imply the bogus and discredited &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuse.</p>
<p>Of note, the IIO came to its conclusion despite that fact that the officer who shot Ford declined to provide a statement or his notes. One can ask how any “investigation” has any veracity or legitimacy when it is not mandatory for Mounties under investigation to provide information, not even their notes, or to be questioned. Such is the dubious and limited nature of so-called investigations of police who kill in Canada.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of this the IIO felt confident in declaring: “(The officer) had to act quickly to protect himself, and had little time to weigh his options. It was reasonable for him to shoot in defense.” Again, it is not clear how shooting someone armed with no more than a knife, who is several feet from the officer who is safely inside a police vehicle can be constituted as an act of defense. It is as if the IIO is writing the officer’s own exoneration note.</p>

2014-11-22,908_CRAP,2014-11-22,,,BC,Vancouver,,Unspecified,,Phuong,Na,Du,,51.0,,,,,,Persons who died following a traffic incident involving a police officer,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention       *<p>It has been announced that the BC Coroners Service will hold a public inquest into the fatal shooting of 51-year-old Phuong Na (Tony) Du by Vancouver police in 2014. Du was killed by Vancouver Police Department (VPD) officers in public while in some psychological distress on Knight Street near 41st Avenue in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Two officers responded to calls about DU with one firing a been bag gun at him  and the other shooting him with a firearm. Du was taken to hospital where he died from the injuries inflicted by police. Du experienced mental illness.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia investigated the killing but charges were not recommended by the Criminal Justice Branch (CJB) for the two officers responsible. The CJB claimed the use of a firearm by one of the officers was justifiable on the basis of his belief that his partner’s life was in danger, despite the fact that the other officer was armed.</p>
<p>In February 2017, Tony Du’s family launched a civil suit against the City of Vancouver and the police officer who fired the fatal shot in the killing. Lawyers representing the victim’s family note that Tony Du was killed between only 18 and 25 seconds after police arrived on the scene. This time was no where near long enough for police to begin a conversation with Du let alone establish his mental condition.</p>
<p>The public inquest into the police killing of Tony Du will commence on February 5, 2018, at the Burnaby Coroners Court. As per usual, the coroner’s jury will be able to make recommendations that might prevent deaths under similar circumstances but which police are under no obligation at all to follow. The jury cannot make any finding of legal responsibility or blame and can not recommend charges against any killer cop.</p>
       *<p>Police in Canada have a horrendous history of killing civilians dealing with mental health issues. Too often police interaction with someone experiencing mental illness or distress results in a quick deployment of often lethal force. The police solution to mental illness is death. And even more police can count on investigations units and prosecutors to use the victims’ mental health against them in deciding not to charge officers who kill quickly. Identities of officers not charge remain undisclosed leaving families without even the names (or ironically without knowledge of the personal histories, including past killings) of the officers who killed their loved ones. Often families of people killed by police in Canada are forced to file lawsuits simply to receive disclosure of basic information about the killing of their family members.</p>
<p>On Thursday, February 9, 2017, the family of Phuong Na Du, Tony Du, a Vancouver man shot and killed by police in November of 2014 launched a civil suit against the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Department officer involved in the shooting. Pivot Legal, a local civil rights law group, announced the lawsuit right after the Crown prosecutor announced that the Vancouver police officer who killed Du would not be charged.</p>
<p>Tony Du experienced, who experienced schizophrenia, was killed by police after officers arrived on the scene at Knight Street near East 41st Street. Witnesses reported seeing the victim appearing distraught  and waving a two-by-four. Du was shot by one officer and hit with a bean bag round fired by another and died in hospital of the injuries inflicted by police. Police explained the decision to shoot by saying the man would not immediately comply with officers’ orders. Failure to immediately comply is too often viewed by police as an invitation to shoot and a license to kill. And investigations and prosecutors reinforce this arrogant view by refusing to bring charges against cops who kill under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The provincial oversight body, the Independent Investigations Office (which is not truly independent of police an trains through the police training center, the Justice Institute of British Columbia) investigated the killing and submitted its report to the Crown in the fall of 2016. That report disclosed that DU was shot and killed a mere 18 to 25 seconds after police arrived on the scene. This calls entirely into question, indeed refutes, the police claim that the victim had time to understand and respond to officers’ orders. This short time frame was neither long enough to start a conversation with Du nor enough time to assess his mental state or intentions. Pivot Legal lawyer Douglas King suggests that the police undertook instead “a very intense and rapid escalation” one that raises some “serious concerns” (quoted in CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Crown prosecutors are almost uniformly reluctant to charge officers given their need to work with police on cases and the perceived impact a lack of police cooperation could have on their career trajectory. So it was in no way surprising that the Criminal Justice Branch in British Columbia released a statement saying that the evidence gathered did not meet the criteria for approval of charges in connection with the police shooting death of Tony Du. Said the Crown, grimly, of the killer cop in this case: “He continued firing until the suspect was no longer a threat” (quoted in CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Indeed. And no charges result.</p>

The Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) officer was in an unmarked police cruiser, tailing a suspect at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, when he struck and killed Nicholas Thorne-Belance in Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>In a ruling issued Thursday, July 19, 2018, in Longueuil, Quebec court Judge Éric Simard concluded there was nothing to justify the speed at which Ouellet was driving and that there were “inherent” risks in that activity.</p>
<p>Wrote Simard in his decision: “His failure to take steps to avoid such risks constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation would follow” (quoted in Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet reached a speed of 134 km/h on Gaétan-Boucher Boulevard in the period before the accident — and 108 km/h at the moment of impact. At the intersection of Gaétan-Boucher and Davis, Ouellet struck a vehicle carrying two children in the backseat. Nicholas Thorne-Belance was critically injured and died in hospital five days later (Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet had tried to claim in trial that the crash was unavoidable. The Crown argued that the driving was “objectively dangerous.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, the Crown had initially decided to not lay charges. That decision was only reversed in 2015 after Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid growing community outcry. The first inclination of the state is always to protect the state. Community mobilization can affect that.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for October 22, 2018. Convictions for dangerous driving causing death carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. We will see if a killer cop gets anything near that.</p>

       *<p>On Monday, June 11, 2018, trial began for killer cop Patrick Ouellet of the provincial police force, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), in the death of five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance in 2014. Officer Ouellet is charged with one count of dangerous driving causing death in the case. Thorne-Belance was a passenger in his father’s car when it was struck by the unmarked police cruiser driven by Ouellet. Ouellet’s vehicle was traveling at more than 120 km/h in a 50 km/h zone in the Longueuil borough of Saint-Hubert, south of Montreal when he hit the vehicle the five-year-old  was in. The trial is scheduled to last two weeks.</p>

Guy Blouin died in hospital from the fatal chest injuries inflicted by Beaulieu.</p>
<p>On October 13, 2017 the first witness testified in Beaulieu’s trial with the officer facing charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Yves Brière, a crime scene reconstruction expert with the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force, testified that Beaulieu’s police cruiser hit and killed Guy Blouin while backing up on a one-way street at 44 kilometers an hour.</p>
<p>Brière showed Québec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière photos of the police cruiser, and explained that Blouin and the bicycle slid under the car, at the corner of Saint-François Est and du Parvis streets, in the Saint-Roch neighborhood. Blouin was run over with the right rear wheel of the cruiser. Brière testified that by the time the police car driven by Beaulieu had stopped, Blouin’s body was lying seven meters away. The police car’s bumper showed several rubber marks where the bicycle slid under the car, according to Brière.</p>
<p>Incredibly officer Beaulieu was promoted from constable to sergeant-detective <em>after</em> driving over and killing Guy Boulin. And people wonder why the public might be skeptical about prospects for police accountability within a system that depends on and rewards killer cops. Killer cop Beaulieu has been on desk duty pending his trial.</p>
       *<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>

1994-05-06,273_CRAP,1994-05-06,,,QC,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Serge,,Pierre,,46.0,,,,,,Persons who died by suicide during a police intervention,,,,,,"Persons who died IN police custody       *<p>We have written extensively on the lack of proper public reporting of police killings of civilians in Canada, the fact that police control the flow of information and what is released publicly, and the lack of truly independent and autonomous oversight of police in Canada. Not all provinces in Canada have oversight agencies at all to investigate cases of police harm to civilians and those that exist are not truly independent or autonomous. Some, like the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI) in Quebec rely on active police force members for investigations.</p>
<p>These facts were put fully, and painfully and violently, on display on Wednesday, February 7, 2018, as the family of Montreal police shooting victim Pierre Coriolan announced that they are suing the City of Montreal over the “brutal and excessive” police intervention in which their loved one was killed by officer on June 27, 2017. The family also released a horrific video  of the police killing taken by a neighbor on a cellphone and passed to the family recently. It shows Coriolan being shot approximately 45 seconds into the police intervention. Lawyers for the Coriolan family suggest that the entire direct encounter lasted about one minute and ten seconds, during which time multiple weapons were used against the victim, including after he had been shot by police and was on the ground.</p>
<p>Pierre, Coriolan, a 58-year-old Black immigrant from Haiti, was shot and killed by in the hallway outside his apartment after police reportedly responded to calls about a man yelling and smashing things inside his apartment on Robillard Avenue near St-André Street, in the city’s gay village.</p>
<p>The killing again raises issues of police violence, poverty, racism, and mental health issues. In addition, there have been concerns about the information provided publicly by police and the BEI regarding the killings of civilians by police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Video</p>
<p>The four minute cellphone video, recorded by the neighbor, an eyewitness to the killing, shows a chaotic scene in the hallway of the apartment building. Officers apparently use plastic bullets, a taser, and their firearms against Coriolan. He was allegedly holding some object, variously described as a screwdriver or a knife.</p>
<p>The BEI have reported in a statement released at the time of the shooting that police first received 911 calls about Coriolan making noise in his apartment at about 7 PM. The cellphone video begins at 7:30 PM. It is not certain from the video how long officers had been on the scene at that point or what their engagement with Coriolan involved up to that point.</p>
<p>The first five seconds of the video are audio only, without recorded video images. The audio records what is believed to be a gun firing a plastic bullet, followed by the crackling sound of a taser having been fired. Five officers then become visible with weapons drawn. They are crowded into the hallway, their backs to the camera. Other officers off-camera can be heard yelling from around a corner in the hallway.</p>
<p>Pierre Coriolan comes into view eight seconds into the video. He appears to exit his apartment and walk toward the officers. Very soon after he moves from his apartment two or three gunshots are heard, but the image is obscured as the neighbor with the camera ducks somewhat into his apartment. When the camera focuses back on the hallway, an officer is heard yelling, “À terre! (Hit the ground!).”</p>
<p>Coriolan is in view, on his knees, with four officers visible, and still pointing weapons at him. The victim is heard telling the officers, in French, “Pas capable (I can&#8217;t).”</p>
<p>At that point, one of the officers is heard, incredibly, asking a colleague in French, “Do you have another shot?” After an unintelligible response, the officer yells, “Take the other shot.”</p>
<p>At that point, two shots ring out. It is not clear what has been fired, plastic bullets or live ammunition.</p>
<p>In response to the gunshots, Pierre Coriolan collapses fully on the ground. Only his legs are visible in the frame. Only then is an officer heard to yell, “Knife.”</p>
<p>A first officer approaches Coriolan and kneeling beside him, appears to search for a weapon, rather than offering any medical care or attention. Shockingly, another officer then approaches Coriolan, extends a telescopic baton, and swings it twice with heavy force toward the victim’s arm. Coriolan is heard to grunt in pain.</p>
<p>Officers lower their weapons, and one is heard speaking into his radio to say, “A man, possibly injured by gunshot.” Clearly they knew he had been hit and injured.</p>
<p>The officers are standing talking to each other calmly. One says, “It’s a screwdriver he had.” Another officer says, “No, it was a knife.” Only then are officers heard saying, “He’s injured. He’s hit.”</p>
<p>Coriolan’s legs can be seen convulsing as one officer says the stricken man is still breathing. Another officer responds saying, “No, he’s not breathing.”</p>
<p>The video ends when an officer demands that witnesses in the hallway get back into their apartments. Pierre Coriolan would be pronounced dead later that evening in hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disturbing Actions Leave Disturbing Questions</p>
<p>Pierre Coriolan’s killing was met with protests and calls for action by community activists and organizers, including Black Lives Matter organizers. Community activists Will Prosper and Maguy Métellus joined the family’s lawyers and Joanne Coriolan, the victim’s niece at the press conference releasing the video and announcing the family lawsuit. The lawsuit was launched by two of Coriolan’s sisters who were not present at the news conference. They are seeking a total of $163,426 in damages.</p>
<p>Prosper, a former RCMP officer, expressed shock and disbelief upon first viewing the video. In his words: “The first question I asked myself is, ‘Why don’t you take the time?’ There&#8217;s no rush” (quoted Rukavina in 2018).</p>
<p>Prosper raised the question on everyone’s mind since the killing last year, which is why a man was shot and killed for making noise in his own apartment. As Prosper points out: ”The only thing Pierre was threatening was his own apartment. He was not a threat to anybody else” (quoted in Rukavina 2018).</p>
<p>Prosper was even more stark in his questioning of why a kneeling man was viewed as such a threat. He asks: “What is the threat of a black man kneeling down? It’s a firing squad he’s facing” (quoted in Rukavina 2018).</p>
<p>The only time on the video recording that police even directly speak to Coriolan is when they order him to the ground <em>after</em> he has already been shot. Says Propser: “You see there’s no communication, nothing mentioned to him as he&#8217;s kneeling down” (quoted in Rukavina 2018). After the man has been shot and is on the ground police do not even ask after his condition. Instead they hit him with a telescopic baton.</p>
<p>Alain Arsenault, a member of the family’s legal team, said that they have little faith in the BEI investigation and that said a lawsuit is the best available avenue to obtain justice for Coriolan. It may be the only way that the public can find out any meaningful information about the actions of police.</p>
<p>Arsenault said that the decision to release the video was prompted partly by frustration over the slow pace of the investigation and the oversight agency’s refusal to provide updates to the family. These are repeated concerns expressed by family members of people killed by police across Canada.</p>

       *<p>An intersection of racism, poverty, mental health distress, and police violence has once again had a  deadly outcome. The 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police has been identified as Pierre Coriolan, a Black male of Haitian background who was know to suffer mental health issues. It has now been further revealed that Coriolan was facing eviction from the apartment he had been living in since 2008 on July 1, 2017, and that this had understandably greatly distressed him. The eviction order was issued against Mr. Coriolan by the Quebec rental board on June 1 according to Claudine Laurin, director general of la Fédération des OSBL d’habitation de Montréal, an organization of subsidized housing apartments. That a subsidized housing association would evict someone over mental health issues is troubling.</p>
<p>Police were supposedly responding to a call that Mr. Coriolan was breaking things in his apartment when they showed up and shot him. It has not been stated publicly why police chose to shoot someone multiple times for smashing his apartment but the earlier mentioned intersectional factors offer something of an answer, particularly the engrained violence of police. When Urgence-Santé arrived at the scene of the shooting around 7:30 PM, Mr. Coriolan was in cardiac arrest. He was taken to hospital and died at about 9:45 PM.</p>
<p>Neighbors have said that they sometimes heard Mr. Coriolan screaming and plates breaking in the apartment but insist that he did not bother them and they understood that he was not well. They did not fear him and were not disturbed by him. Neighbors expressed shock over the police actions.</p>

The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, or “BEI,” the body that investigates police-involved deaths in Quebec, handed its report to Quebec’s prosecutors office and to the Office of the Coroner on March 2.  On the basis of this report, prosecutors will determine whether charges should be laid against the police officers involved in the death of 48-year-old Sandy Alaku, the BEI said in a news release on Monday, March 9.  The BEI said its investigation found:  • On July 5, 2019, at about 10:30 p.m., several calls were made to the KRPF concerning a fight involving several people in a Salluit residence. Two police arrived on the scene and saw someone in front of the house. That individual was dragging a man who seemed unconscious and was bleeding profusely in the head.  • The police quickly left their vehicle to stop and control the attacker.  • As they tried to handcuff the attacker, the police vehicle started to move slowly, “by itself,” and rolled on to the back of Alaku who was still lying on the ground, on his stomach, the BEI said.  • The police went to help Alaku and took him to the health centre.  • After several resuscitation attempts, Alaku’s death was declared at 11:45 p.m.  Salluit, on Nunavik’s Hudson Strait, has a population of about 1,600 people.  The BEI said its entire report on Alaku’s death would not be made public because it contained sensitive and confidential information, including statements from those involved and witnesses.       ***<p>A 58-year-old assault victim who had been badly beaten was killed when an improperly parked vehicle of the Kativik Regional Police Force rolled over him. The death occurred in Salluit, Nunavut, on the evening of July 5, 2019. Allegedly responding to a call about a brawl, police moved to make an arrest rather than ensuring their vehicle was securely parked. The man was pronounced dead at a local health center.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (Bureau of Independent Investigations, BEI), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians, has dispatched eight investigators to look into the killing. The BEI is not truly an independent agency as it relies on police to carry out investigations. A collision expert with the Quebec provincial police force, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), will be involved in this investigation.</p>

The BEI opened an investigation following the death of Jonathan Roy during an intervention by the Service de police de Sherbrooke at around 10:15 a.m. on July 25.  When the police arrived, Jonathan Roy had fled. He was caught by a patroller who had to use cayenne pepper to subdue him. He then lost consciousness. The 33-year-old was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Eight BEI investigators were assigned to investigate this event. In accordance with the Regulation respecting the conduct of investigations of the Bureau des inquiries independent, the BEI called on the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) to act as a support police force in this investigation.  The patroller involved in this affair has resumed service on the patrol.  The BEI continues to review the circumstances surrounding this event.  The coroner's office also formally identified Suzanne Desjardins for an event that occurred in Drummondville.  The 57-year-old was reportedly killed by her son on July 26.  Jean-Luc Ferland has been accused of the murder of his mother which was allegedly committed on rue Pinard.  The victim's spouse, Steve Girard, believes that the death of the 57-year-old woman could have been avoided if the Sûreté du Québec had acted immediately to help her control her son who lives with mental health problems.  The victim went to the SQ station at around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday to request police assistance to force her son to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. She was found dead the next day at her home.  The BEI is also continuing to review the circumstances surrounding this event.

Sheffield Matthews, 41, was also a father, and he spent nearly all his earnings on his children, to the extent that he sometimes went hungry, said Sabrina Folland in a video posted on Facebook on Friday afternoon.  “I want people to know who he was, and I don’t want him to be painted…as something that he’s not,” said Folland, who described Matthews as “a very good family friend.”  Matthews, who was Black, died early Thursday after police shot him on a thoroughfare in the NDG borough in west-end Montreal.  He was in crisis and wielding a knife when officers drove up around 6 a.m., according to the police watchdog agency, which is now investigating how police handled the case. The officers stepped out of their vehicle and ended up shooting him.   ""I just don’t really want to talk too much about the situation, but I want to talk about Sheffield’s character,” said Folland, who cried throughout the video.   She said she didn’t want him to simply be “transformed” into a narrative of “someone who was was just suffering with mental illness and wasn’t doing well and that racist police shot him.”  She said Matthews was a gentle person overall who had a really dark moment.  “Sheffield was working in an old folks' home, taking care of old people,” she said.  “He was so kind, so thoughtful, you know, working in that environment—it's not always easy and a lot of people don't want to do it. But he did it and he did it well.”

2017-11-08,127_CRAP,2017-11-08,,,QC,Montreal,,Unspecified,,Tshiteya,,Kalubi,,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Persons who died IN police custody       ***<p>A 23-year old man has died in police custody after being transferred to the Montreal municipal courthouse. The Independent Investigations Bureau (BEI), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec, has assigned a team of 15 investigators to examine the circumstances of the death. According to the BEI, initial reports suggest the victim was arrested by Montreal police at 10:40 PM on the evening of Tuesday, November 7, 2017. On Wednesday, November 8, at around 7:30 AM he was transferred to the Montreal municipal courthouse where he was set to await his court appearance later that day. BEI claims that at around 8:55 AM officers assigned to watch the prisoners became aware that the victim was on the ground and apparently unconscious. He was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead only one hour later. Details of this case have not been independently confirmed publicly.</p>
       *<p>Quebec’s Independent Investigations Bureau (BEI), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the in custody death of David Tshiteya Kalubi, a 23-year-old Black youth. Kalubi, who was arrested by Montreal police in his own neighborhood of Hochelaga, was declared dead less that 12 hours after his arrest.</p>
<p>Little information has been released publicly. Police say Kalubi was stopped by officers in Hochelaga and arrested on an outstanding warrant after police ran a background check. The BEI has not stated publicly what the outstanding warrant was for, only that it involved a municipal offense.</p>
<p>Community activists in the city, which has seen many cases of lethal police violence against civilians, and disproportionately against Black people, are raising concerns about Kalubi’s death and the actions of police. Racial profiling and so-called carding, where people are stopped by police and subjected to interrogation and/or background checks, have been strongly condemned by community members in cities across Canada. Carding goes hand in hand with profiling as Black people are disproportionately stopped for carding checks in Canadian contexts. Kalubi is of Congolese background.</p>
<p>Montreal police reportedly took Kalubi to the station, where he spent the night before being transferred to the municipal courthouse in Old Montreal to appear before a judge, according to the BEI. The transfer took place at 7:35 AM. Only a little more than an hour later, at 8:55 AM, a guard noticed that Kalubi was on the floor and appeared to be unconscious. He was then taken to the hospital and declared dead at 9:55 AM. Community members are raising concerns that Kalubi was subjected to differential, discriminatory, treatment because of histories of police racism in Montreal. The family, for its part has not raised the issues of racial profiling. According to the family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire: “For the moment, there’s not enough information to know if it’s a case of racial profiling, but with a young black man arrested it can look like racial profiling” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Dan Philip, the executive director of the Black Coalition of Quebec has said publicly that it took police seven hours to notify his mother and family of Kalubi’s death. Even then, police took the opportunity to  first interrogated the family about Kalubi, before telling them he was dead, according to Philip. Said Philip, in an interview with CBC News: “They felt it was a travesty. They felt there was no compassion. They felt that there was no concern about either the death of the young man or the family themselves who have to mourn the situation” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Community advocates have little confidence that the BEI will provide satisfactory answers to the family’s many questions. Critics have long pointed out that the BEI includes several former police officers among its active members.  As Philips suggests: “It’s the police investigating the police. They have no interest in finding out why did he died and what negligence caused his death” (quoted in MacArthur 2017). It has also been pointed out repeatedly that the BEI lacks any meaningful diversity. It is expected that their report will not be released for another year yet.</p>

Yet police continue to engage in them even where the fleeing person is only suspected of harmless or minimally harmful activity. And people continue to be killed as a result.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2018, a 63-year-old man was killed during a police chase in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. Initial reports suggest that the incident occurred around noon as the car that the victim was riding in was hit by a vehicle driven by someone in a high-speed pursuit by police.</p>
<p>According to Quebec&#8217;s bureau of independent investigations (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, BEI), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, the chase started during a police crackdown on people not wearing seat belts and involved police pursuing a vehicle with an expired license plate. For that police were willing to throw all care to the wind—and a person was killed as a result.</p>
<p>The BEI has assigned 12  investigators to the case.</p>
       ***<p>Killer cop Patrick Ouellet has been found guilty of dangerous driving in the death of five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance on Montreal&#8217;s South Shore in 2014. The Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) officer was in an unmarked police cruiser, tailing a suspect at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, when he struck and killed Nicholas Thorne-Belance in Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>In a ruling issued Thursday, July 19, 2018, in Longueuil, Quebec court Judge Éric Simard concluded there was nothing to justify the speed at which Ouellet was driving and that there were “inherent” risks in that activity.</p>
<p>Wrote Simard in his decision: “His failure to take steps to avoid such risks constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation would follow” (quoted in Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet reached a speed of 134 km/h on Gaétan-Boucher Boulevard in the period before the accident — and 108 km/h at the moment of impact. At the intersection of Gaétan-Boucher and Davis, Ouellet struck a vehicle carrying two children in the backseat. Nicholas Thorne-Belance was critically injured and died in hospital five days later (Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet had tried to claim in trial that the crash was unavoidable. The Crown argued that the driving was “objectively dangerous.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, the Crown had initially decided to not lay charges. That decision was only reversed in 2015 after Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid growing community outcry. The first inclination of the state is always to protect the state. Community mobilization can affect that.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for October 22, 2018. Convictions for dangerous driving causing death carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. We will see if a killer cop gets anything near that.</p>

Yet police continue to engage in them even where the fleeing person is only suspected of harmless or minimally harmful activity. And people continue to be killed as a result.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2018, a 63-year-old man was killed during a police chase in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. Initial reports suggest that the incident occurred around noon as the car that the victim was riding in was hit by a vehicle driven by someone in a high-speed pursuit by police.</p>
<p>According to Quebec&#8217;s bureau of independent investigations (Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, BEI), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, the chase started during a police crackdown on people not wearing seat belts and involved police pursuing a vehicle with an expired license plate. For that police were willing to throw all care to the wind—and a person was killed as a result.</p>
<p>The BEI has assigned 12  investigators to the case.</p>
       ***<p>Killer cop Patrick Ouellet has been found guilty of dangerous driving in the death of five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance on Montreal&#8217;s South Shore in 2014. The Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) officer was in an unmarked police cruiser, tailing a suspect at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, when he struck and killed Nicholas Thorne-Belance in Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>In a ruling issued Thursday, July 19, 2018, in Longueuil, Quebec court Judge Éric Simard concluded there was nothing to justify the speed at which Ouellet was driving and that there were “inherent” risks in that activity.</p>
<p>Wrote Simard in his decision: “His failure to take steps to avoid such risks constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation would follow” (quoted in Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet reached a speed of 134 km/h on Gaétan-Boucher Boulevard in the period before the accident — and 108 km/h at the moment of impact. At the intersection of Gaétan-Boucher and Davis, Ouellet struck a vehicle carrying two children in the backseat. Nicholas Thorne-Belance was critically injured and died in hospital five days later (Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet had tried to claim in trial that the crash was unavoidable. The Crown argued that the driving was “objectively dangerous.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, the Crown had initially decided to not lay charges. That decision was only reversed in 2015 after Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid growing community outcry. The first inclination of the state is always to protect the state. Community mobilization can affect that.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for October 22, 2018. Convictions for dangerous driving causing death carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. We will see if a killer cop gets anything near that.</p>

Quebec’s investigations unit, ​the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, claims that initial information suggests the 20-year-old driver of a vehicle being chased by Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) crashed into a parked vehicle. The young man was killed in the impact of the crash.</p>
<p>The BEI reports that the chase started when police tried to pull the SUV driver over because of an alleged traffic violation. The SQ decided to initiate a pursuit even though they are known to put lives at risk and even though the initial interaction was over only a traffic violation.</p>
<p>The BEI has assigned eight investigators to examine what occurred. The BEI is not an independent agency and they rely on the Montreal police service to provide a forensic identification expert and two collision reconstruction experts.</p>
       ***<p>On August 21, 2018 Montreal police shot and killed 23-year-old Nicholas Gibbs, a young Black man. He was shot five times, twice in the back. On October 30, 2018, eyewitness video of the police killing of Nicholas Gibbs was released publicly by the Gibbs family and their support network. The video clearly shows that Nicholas Gibbs posed no direct threat to police when he was killed. Police shouted at him in French only, though Gibbs spoke English. The family has announced a lawsuit against the Montreal police.</p>
<p>Nicholas Gibbs was the father of three young children. A fundraising campaign has been established to support the Gibbs family through this awful time. Families of people killed by police are not eligible for any of the state support that is now made available to victims of criminal acts.</p>

Ouellet had been found guilty of dangerous driving causing death in July 2018 for crashing his police vehicle into the car in which Thorne-Belance was riding, killing the child.</p>
<p>Ouellet was driving an unmarked police cruiser at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone in Saint-Hubert, when he smashed into the side of the car carrying Nicholas, his sister and his father.</p>
<p>Quebec court Judge Éric Simard handed down the sentence on November 18 at the Longueuil courthouse. In addition to the eight-month sentence, Ouellet will also be banned from driving for 20 months.</p>
<p>Crown lawyer Geneviève Langlois said the sentence was intended to make a statement: “The incarceration sends a clear message to the police community regarding the criminal behavior adopted by police officers in the course of their duties.”</p>
<p>This is a curious statement given the shortness of the sentence and the fact that initially the Crown did not even press charges against Ouellet. At the time they said that speeding was not a sufficient reason to lay charges.</p>
<p>It was only after immense public outcry that the case was examined closely, and charges brought forward. Then-justice minister Stephanie Vallée appointed a panel of independent prosecutors, including a retired judge, to look at the case. Ouellet was only charged in May 2015, more than a year after the crash.<br />
Killer cop Ouellet is currently appealing the verdict.</p>
       *<p>Killer cop Patrick Ouellet has been found guilty of dangerous driving in the death of five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance on Montreal&#8217;s South Shore in 2014. The Quebec provincial police (Sûreté du Québec, SQ) officer was in an unmarked police cruiser, tailing a suspect at more than 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, when he struck and killed Nicholas Thorne-Belance in Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>In a ruling issued Thursday, July 19, 2018, in Longueuil, Quebec court Judge Éric Simard concluded there was nothing to justify the speed at which Ouellet was driving and that there were “inherent” risks in that activity.</p>
<p>Wrote Simard in his decision: “His failure to take steps to avoid such risks constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation would follow” (quoted in Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet reached a speed of 134 km/h on Gaétan-Boucher Boulevard in the period before the accident — and 108 km/h at the moment of impact. At the intersection of Gaétan-Boucher and Davis, Ouellet struck a vehicle carrying two children in the backseat. Nicholas Thorne-Belance was critically injured and died in hospital five days later (Turnbull 2018).</p>
<p>Ouellet had tried to claim in trial that the crash was unavoidable. The Crown argued that the driving was “objectively dangerous.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, the Crown had initially decided to not lay charges. That decision was only reversed in 2015 after Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid growing community outcry. The first inclination of the state is always to protect the state. Community mobilization can affect that.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for October 22, 2018. Convictions for dangerous driving causing death carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. We will see if a killer cop gets anything near that.</p>

       *<p>On Monday, June 11, 2018, trial began for killer cop Patrick Ouellet of the provincial police force, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), in the death of five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance in 2014. Officer Ouellet is charged with one count of dangerous driving causing death in the case. Thorne-Belance was a passenger in his father’s car when it was struck by the unmarked police cruiser driven by Ouellet. Ouellet’s vehicle was traveling at more than 120 km/h in a 50 km/h zone in the Longueuil borough of Saint-Hubert, south of Montreal when he hit the vehicle the five-year-old  was in. The trial is scheduled to last two weeks.</p>
       *<p>Killer Quebec cop Patrick Ouellet, a member of the provincial force the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), will not have the charge dropped for killing  five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance in 2014, a Quebec judge has decided. Ouellet had filed a motion seeking to have the charge of dangerous driving causing death dropped and has alleged interference in the case by Quebec Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée.</p>
<p>Ouellet was involved in a police surveillance operation in which he was tailing the director of the Quebec Liberal Party in an unmarked car on February 13, 2014. During this operation officer Ouellet crashed into a car in which Thorne-Belance was a passenger in Longueuil, south of Montreal. Oullet’s care was traveling at a speed in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in a 50 km/hr zone. The young Thorne-Belance died in a hospital a few days after the crash.</p>
<p>The Crown prosecutor had initially decided not to lay charges, the usual result in cases of police killing civilians, even children, in Canada. A single charge was filed against Ouellet in 2015 after Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid strong public pressure. Quebec Court Judge Denys Noel ruled on November 21, 2017, that there was no interference on Vallée’s part. Concluded Judge Noel: “One cannot infer from the evidence that the minister ordered the director (to file the charge). There is no evidence of abuse of procedure that would allow for the proceedings to be dropped.” Killer cop  Patrick Ouellet’s trial is scheduled to begin in June, 2018.</p>

Killer cops are rarely charged in Canada. And when they are, they are typically acquitted, even in cases in which they have obviously acted in a dubious, reckless, or murderous manner.</p>
<p>Quebec City police officer Simon Beaulieu backed his police car over Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, killing the 48-year-old. Beaulieu used this lethal force against Blouin for no other reason than a baseless suspicion that Blouin had stolen a bike. This was apparently a case of class-based police profiling of a working class person in a working class neighborhood. Blouin had, in fact purchased his bike. Officer Beaulieu was charged in October 2015 of criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing death after he struck and killed Blouin.</p>
<p>On Friday, January 12, 2018, killer cops Beaulieu was found not guilty on both counts by Quebec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière. A not surprising result, no matter how unjust.</p>
<p>De la Sablonnière said the elements of proof presented to him did not show without a reasonable doubt that Beaulieu&#8217;s actions that day were dangerous, despite the fact that he sped backwards the wrong way on a one way street and drove over a cyclist who had, in fact done nothing wrong and posed no threat to the public or the officer. The judge concluded: “This was a sad and unfortunate accident” (quoted in Page 2018). But actively driving backwards over someone on a bike is not an “accident.”</p>
<p>The judge reached his conclusion despite the fact that the Crown prosecutor&#8217;s expert witness was a Sûreté du Québec crime reconstruction expert (another cop) who testified the police cruiser was going 44 kilometers per hour when it struck Blouin. The judge simply decided to side with the defense version of events which posed the police cruiser’s speed at 22 kilometers per hour. Why side with defense (posing a self-interested estimate) against one provided by a police expert (usually believed unquestioningly in cases against civilians)? The answer is that the state is always predisposed to protect the state in cases of police harm to civilians, under even the most egregious circumstances.</p>
<p>Incredibly, De la Sablonnière said Beaulieu made sure the coast was clear before backing up. This despite that obvious case that it was not clear—as evidenced by the fact that <em>he ran Blouin over</em>. How could he have ensured the coast was clear? Then the judge blamed faulty ABS brakes, a scenario only raised by a defense promoted and provided witness. Said de la Sablonnière: “He could not foresee there was a problem with the brakes” (quoted in Page 2018). But why was he speeding backward toward someone on a bicycle anyway? That is the question.</p>
<p>Throughout his ruling De la Sablonnière repeated that in order for a person to be found guilty of criminal negligence, his actions had to be significantly out of step with what is considered to be normal behavior. But he made sure to stress that normal or expected behavior had to be considered differently for police officers than for civilians (see the contradiction there—normal defined as different for some).</p>
<p>Stuart Edwards, a member of a citizens&#8217; committee from the working class Saint-Roch neighborhood where the accident happened, pointed out that the reasoning behind the ruling is hard to accept (Page 2018). And clearly it is for anyone not ready to accept class-profiling of poor ad working class people or to treat police in a privileged manner within a legal system that otherwise brags of “equality before the law” (yes, we know that is a myth).</p>
<p>Said Edwards, from the committee formed in response to Blouin’s killing and who was present in court at each step in the trial: “That’s a judicial impunity for a policeman, because he’s a policeman. I don&#8217;t buy that. I’m personally disappointed. I don’t accept this — I think it’s wrong” (quoted in Page 2018).</p>
<p>As should we all. And Edwards noted that the committee is very much concerned with the effect the not guilty ruling will have in the community. It validates the exertion of lethal force by police against people in a poor and working class community under any circumstances and  with impunity.</p>
<p>The city’s “police brotherhood” confirmed that concern saying the court decision recognizes that society must give special consideration to police officers. That sounds a lot like a threat.</p>

       *<p>Québec City police officer Simon Beaulieu killed 48-year-old Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, striking the victim with his vehicle. Guy Blouin died in hospital from the fatal chest injuries inflicted by Beaulieu.</p>
<p>On October 13, 2017 the first witness testified in Beaulieu’s trial with the officer facing charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Yves Brière, a crime scene reconstruction expert with the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force, testified that Beaulieu’s police cruiser hit and killed Guy Blouin while backing up on a one-way street at 44 kilometers an hour.</p>
<p>Brière showed Québec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière photos of the police cruiser, and explained that Blouin and the bicycle slid under the car, at the corner of Saint-François Est and du Parvis streets, in the Saint-Roch neighborhood. Blouin was run over with the right rear wheel of the cruiser. Brière testified that by the time the police car driven by Beaulieu had stopped, Blouin’s body was lying seven meters away. The police car’s bumper showed several rubber marks where the bicycle slid under the car, according to Brière.</p>
<p>Incredibly officer Beaulieu was promoted from constable to sergeant-detective <em>after</em> driving over and killing Guy Boulin. And people wonder why the public might be skeptical about prospects for police accountability within a system that depends on and rewards killer cops. Killer cop Beaulieu has been on desk duty pending his trial.</p>
       *<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>

The pursuit and crash occurred on Thanksgiving Day, October 10, 2016, at about 3 AM on Highway 30 in Candiac, Québec, an off-island suburb of Montréal.</p>
<p>The fatal incident started when Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers attempted to intercept a vehicle that was apparently travelling at high speed near the Highway 930 intersection. After s minute long chase the crash occurred, killing the vehicle’s 20-year-old passenger and seriously injuring the driver, also 20. The driver was taken to hospital and remains there in critical condition.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enqûetes independents (BEI), the agency which investigates cases of police harm to civilians, is investigating. The BEI, which has only been operating since the summer of 2016, is composed of former officers and takes assistance from Montréal police, all of which calls into question its possible “independence.”</p>
       ***<p>In the short span  of one day, a mere 24 hours, in early October 2016, police in Québec killed three people who were experiencing some type of mental distress, including at least two where the victims were believed to be suicidal.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening of October 2 the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) responded to a phone call apparently from a man in Île-Perrot threatening to kill himself. Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.</p>
<p>Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Québec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.</p>
<p>Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Québec Police Killing People in Distress</p>
<p>A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the École nationale de police du Québec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Québec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims “in an altered state of consciousness” (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Québec study. And they lack proper training.</p>
<p>To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was “suicide by cop” an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.</p>

An expert in police “use of force” strategies testified at the inquest that the provincial police officer made a number of critical mistakes. A witness to the killing, Chris Houle, who was in the car with Maurice when the teenager was shot has already testified that the shooting “should have been avoided.”</p>
<p>Constable Frédéric Fortier shot the unarmed Maurice at the end of a police chase through Messines, Québec. He and his partner, Constable Dave Constantin, were cleared of criminal wrong doing after an investigation, that was in no way independent and involved Montreal police in 2016.</p>
<p>The inquest has focused on how Fortier approached the car Maurice was driving at the end of a police pursuit. He approached aggressively with his gun drawn and decided to smash the driver’s-side window to open the car door.</p>
<p>Bruno Poulin, an expert with Quebec’s police academy, so not oppositional to police in any way, testified that the encounter should never have ended with that decision. According to Poulin, the officer narrowed his options by approaching the car overly aggressively and expecting he could physically force the driver from the car. A typical thug approach by police who expect they can impose their authority without question and, if necessary, kill to deal with any mess they create.</p>
<p>In Poulin’s words to the inquest: “He put himself in danger” (quoted in 2018). Poulin said it appears that SQ officers need some retraining. We know that training does nothing to change the power police hold in society and the fact that they can kill with impunity as part of the state’s assertion of its monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>In testimony the previous day Fortier acknowledged that he had gotten himself into trouble but said he would not change his decision to shoot.</p>
<p>Brandon Maurice’s family are considering civil action against the police.</p>

The killing took place in the town of St-Cyrille-de-Wendover, near Drummondville, about 115 kilometers northeast of Montréal after two SQ officers apparently responded to a call at approximately 9:45 PM. Police report that the man and a woman, who apparently were in a non-marital relationship, had supposedly argued over ownership of a cell phone. The woman was said to be in a neighbor’s house at the time police arrived. Police have also reported that when they arrived the man was holding a knife. Neighbors have reported hearing two shots fired. The woman’s eight-year-old daughter and father were also at the scene.</p>
<p>Six investigators with the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the Bureau of Independent Investigators, which investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Québec, are investigating the killing of the as yet unnamed victim.

<p>On Sunday evening of October 2 the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) responded to a phone call apparently from a man in Île-Perrot threatening to kill himself. Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.</p>
<p>Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Québec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.</p>
<p>Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Québec Police Killing People in Distress</p>
<p>A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the École nationale de police du Québec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Québec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims “in an altered state of consciousness” (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Québec study. And they lack proper training.</p>
<p>To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was “suicide by cop” an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.</p>

       ***<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>
       ***<p>Police should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues. This is becoming increasingly clear to many as such situations almost inevitably seem to end with the distressed person being killed by cops conditioned to expect the worst in everyone or trained to act on a “comply or die” basis in which any affront to their authority is grounds for immediate execution. Police forces across Canada are killing people experiencing distress on a regular basis. And so often they do so in cases where the distressed person is confined to an indoor setting posing no possible threat to the public. And usually no health care support personnel (doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, etc.) are involved.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 6, 2016, Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police officers shot and killed 29-year-old Danny Lafrance-Godmer during a police invasion of a home on Saint François Xavier Street in Montebello, Québec. Police were apparently responding to a call about a man in distress. They entered the home, eventually going into the attic where they encountered the man identified now as Danny Lafrance-Godmer. It is not clear why, given that police knew Lafrance-Godmer to be in distress and confined to an attic space where he posed no possible threat to the public, the force did not arrange for health care providers to be present to communicate with the man. Instead police engaged the victim immediately and shot him, killing him.</p>
<p>Few details have been released by the bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the relatively new agency that investigates cases of injuries or death involving police in the province. The bureau has assigned nine investigators to examine the case but has a curious policy of relying upon other police forces should they determine they need additional support. In this case they have said they will call upon the Montréal police. This raises real questions about the independence, autonomy, and, finally, legitimacy of any investigation undertaken under such circumstances.</p>

Police had surrounded the residence on Rossini Street in what they claim was a standoff beginning apparently around 9 AM Wednesday, March 22. A bailiff had called local police to report being confronted by a man inside and they claim to have secured a perimeter upon arrival. Sûreté du Québec (SQ) took over the scene around 8 PM Wednesday.</p>
<p>SQ report that they heard gunshots from inside the house at around 1:30 AM on Friday. Entering, in their report, 12 minutes later they claim to have found the man’s body inside the house. The SQ’s SWAT team as well as investigators from the provincial force’s major crime squad, those trained in crisis negotiations, were reportedly on the scene but there has been no confirmation of whether they communicated with the victim at any point. The various police accounts have not been independently confirmed.</p>
       ***<p>On March 22, 2017 trial began for killer Sureté du Quebec (SQ) officer Eric Deslauriers in the killing of 17-year-old David Lacour in Ste. Adele, Quebec on January 22, 2014. Deslauriers shot and killed Lacour after apparently responding to a call about a stolen car. The prosecution argues that Deslauriers shot the teenager rather than have him escape.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare for police officers who kill civilians to be subjected to any punishment. Charges are almost never laid and full trials virtually never held. Killer cops are certainly treated to a different, and decidedly favorable response, from the criminal justice system than are civilians who kill. This is in no way surprising. As we have documented repeatedly, the state protects its officers. And there should be no illusions that the state would deliver anything resembling justice in such cases of state (police) violence.</p>

Oversight agencies, which are not autonomous or independent of police, prosecutors, and judges work to ensure that the state protects the state and killer cops are legitimized. On Wednesday, May 24, 2017 one of those rare events occurred with the laying of charges against Montreal police officer Christian Gilbert who killed 46-year-old Bony Jean-Pierre on March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Murder charges against police are unheard of and officer Gilbert has been charged with manslaughter. He shot Jean-Pierre in the head with a rubber bullet, a projectile that police routinely use, as in protests for example, and which police propagandists pose as non-lethal.  The charges were announced by Quebec’s Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP). Officer Gilbert was released under a promise to appear on July 6, 2017.</p>
<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), Quebec’s investigation unit, which now examines incidents of police harm to civilians was not established when the investigation into Jean-Pierre’s killing was initiated. Instead the charges come, incredibly, following an investigation by Quebec provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ).</p>
<p>The Montreal North community, long angered by police targeting and violence organized and mobilized in response to the police killing of Jean-Pierre. At least 100 people participated in a march and rally in June. At that time some cars and banks were vandalized and objects thrown at the police station in a community uprising. The march occurred on what would have been the 26th birthday of Fredy Villanueva, a young man shot and killed by police in 2008 when Montreal policed moved aggressively to break up a game of dice in a park. Yes, he was killed for playing dice. The killing of Fredy Villanueva highlighted the racist targeted policing practices of Montreal police, reinforced by the killing of Bony Jean-Pierre.</p>

Shots were exchanged, and a man was fatally wounded. Initial reports suggested the man might have shot himself, but an autopsy revealed the man's wounds were not self-inflicted.; Mounties responding to reports of a man threatening self-harm and firing a gun in the air outside a house, found themselves in a standoff. Shots were exchanged, and a man was fatally wounded. Initial reports suggested the man might have shot himself, but an autopsy revealed the man's wounds were not self-inflicted. The IIO investigation into the shooting absolved the officer who shot the man of any wrongdoing.       **<p>There has long been a concern, a suspicion, that police claim victims of police shootings have died of self-inflicted wounds when, in fact, they were killed by officers. (That suspicion has been particularly strong in cases where police investigate police.) One such case was confirmed on Monday, June 26, 2017 when the Internal Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia, the oversight agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians overturned an RCMP claim that the June 18, 2017, death of a Lower Mainland man had died of a self-inflicted wound despite police firing shots at the man. The IIO has determined that the man killed in Port Coquitlam, in fact, died from a police bullet.</p>
<p>In a media release on Juen 26, IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef declared: “Initial reports made to the IIO … by the RCMP, suggested that a distraught male may have shot himself following an exchange of gunfire with police. Following an autopsy, it has been determined that the male’s death was not self-inflicted.” In the initial, confused, report from the RCMP the force had made it seem publicly that the man had killed himself. That was the impression they shaped for the public.</p>
<p>The IIO  reported that it had interviewed six police officers and 30 witnesses over the past week. They have additionally reported that in the hours after the police killing a male relative of the man killed also received “serious injuries.” That situation is still being investigated. No police officers were injured.</p>
<p>While recognizing the numerous problems with the IIO, one can speculate how the initial RCMP claims might have been treated had another police force investigated the present case. RCMP distorting facts for public management after killing someone is not unique in the province as the killing of Robert Dziekanski showed.</p>
       **<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, is investigating the death of a man during an encounter with police in which shots were fired by police. Publicly available details are sketchy at the moment but it is suggested by the IIO that RCMP responded to a report of a distraught man threatening to harm himself outside a home in Port Coquitlam, Metro Vancouver, Sunday June 18, 2017. The IIO statement is unclear and suggests only that the man fired shots  into the air, yet there is an investigation into whether his injuries were self-inflicted. Police are said to have fired weapons during the encounter and the victim was found dead after RCMP fired.</p>

Police were able to get some of the people out of the bank, and negotiators were called in to try to calm the situation, but the crisis ended when two officers shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Police told reporters they weren't certain the man was trying to rob the bank.       **<p>Details are still emerging after police killed a man in an RBC Bank in a commercial plaza in Maple, Ontario, north of Toronto.

<p>Police attended the scene in response to a call at about 1 PM. It is reported that they arrived at the RBC branch to find a gunman as well as a number of other people inside, including staff and clients.

       **<p>Killer Toronto cop James Forcillo has been charged with perjury and attempting to obstruct justice in relation to an attempted bail variation it was announced on December 21, 2017. The 34-year-old Constable Forcillo allegedly lied under oath when he sought a bail variation that would change his primary address. This resulted in the two new charges, according to Toronto police. The charges result from breach of bail allegations by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU). This initiated a separate investigation by the Toronto Police Service’s professional standards unit. Forcillo had his bail revoked in November, 2017, and was taken to a Toronto area jail after authorities found he failed to live with his surety and did not provide information of a change of address.</p>
<p>Forcillo had already secured a place of infamy, even within the dubious history of policing in Canada, for shooting Toronto Youth Sammy Yatim (18) multiple times, killing him, while the teenager was alone on an empty streetcar with no one near, and posing no threat to police or the public. Forcillo was convicted in 2016 of attempted murder for that 2013 killing, because he shot Sammy Yatim even after the youth had fallen to ground and was already dead or dying, and was sentenced to six years. Civilian video of the police interaction went viral and showed that Yatim posed no threat to police or the public yet was shot and killed anyway.</p>
<p>Forcillo had been out on bail while awaiting appeal of that conviction. He is seeking to use the bogus “suicide by cop” excuse to get off (even though he had a choice not to shoot Yatim and even though he shot him after he was on the ground and not moving—hardly suicide in either case). Current court records show that Forcillo had applied to have the conditions of his bail changed so that he could live with his new fiancée, Sara Balderrama, at an apartment in north Toronto. However, before that application was approved, investigators visited Balderrama’s apartment and found Forcillo already there. The records allege that he told investigators his new arrangement was “only temporary”and suggest it was Forcillo, not his fiancée, who had signed the lease.</p>
<p>Killer cop Forcillo remains in custody and is scheduled to appear in court to face the new charges on December 29, 2017.</p>
       **<p>After five years, a date has finally been set for the inquest into the death in police custody of 37-year-old Ina Matawapit, at the Weagamow Lake Nursing Station in North Caribou Lake First Nation, in northern Ontario. Matawapit died on June 7, 2012 after a transfer from a police vehicle while in custody. Matawapit’s case was one of several that have been egregiously delayed due to widespread problems with Indigenous representation on jury rolls. This ongoing, entrenched problem has characterized criminal justice systems and inquests in the Canadian state context. At least 20 cases in Ontario have been delayed by province’s jury roll problems.</p>
<p>The inquest into Matawapit’s death is mandatory under the Coroners Act because she was in custody at the time. The inquest will examine the circumstances surrounding her death by hearing from about 10 witnesses over the scheduled six days of proceedings. Dr. Michael Wilson will be presiding coroner during the inquest which is scheduled to begin at 9:30 AM on February 12, 2018 at the Days Inn in Sioux Lookout, Ontario.</p>

The investigation found that the unnamed man's fatal injuries occurred prior to police contact.       **<p>What do you do if you come across someone severely beaten and bleeding in a home? If you are RCMP in British Columbia, the answer is shoot them with a stun gun. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating after a man died in custody in Coquitlam after having been hit with a stun gun by officers.</p>
<p>RCMP claim they were responding to a call regarding a supposedly agitated man possibly trying to break into homes late in the evening of Wednesday, October 19, 2016, in the 1500 block of Balmoral Drive. Upon finding the man severely beaten and bleeding police shot him with a stun gun and entered into a physical confrontation of some sort with the man. He went into medical distress shortly after being taken into custody. Emergency Health Services performed CPR on the man who was taken to hospital. It is reported that he was pronounced dead at hospital shortly before midnight. Additional details have not been released as the IIO investigates.</p>
       **<p>In a September 2014 incident near Valemount, British Columbia, RCMP Emergency Response Team members fired several shots killing 51-year-old John Buehler and injuring his daughter Shanna Buehler. All of this happened in an attempt to arrest the man simply for failing to appear in court. Following an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the Criminal Justice Branch in BC decided, for reasons that are not yet clear, not to lay charges against the four officers involved in the multiple shootings and killing. This despite the finding by the IIO investigators that Buehler did not shoot at officers as police claimed. Still the Crown decided not to pursue a case against the officers and little more has been said about the attempt by police to justify the shootings and killing by falsely claiming they were only returning fire. The announcement of no charges was released on October 20, 2016, more than two years after the killing.</p>
       **<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer’s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consideration of Charges?</p>
<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.” (quoted in Johnstone 2016)</p>
<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Justice for Hudson”</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: “I wouldn’t say I’m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for “Justice For Hudson” to raise awareness about Hudson’s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.</p>
<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: “We’re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism</p>

We believe the Calgary police officer could’ve taken different steps dealing with Robin (and that) a Taser could’ve been used instead of shooting our cousin. My cousin isn’t the type of person to be an aggressor.” (quoted in Laing 2019).</p>
<p>Another cousin, Angela Fiddler, has reflected on Robin Fiddler’s determination and humor. In her words:</p>
<p>“She always tried to get through whatever systemic barriers that she faced — she always tried to make a way. She was just a blessing to us. It was her smile, she was always so funny and she always wanted to make people laugh.<br />
“When we were both younger, I just took her under my wing and that was that. She would come live with me when she had the opportunity. I’ve always had an open door for her. Robin was a beautiful soul, she deserved to live.”</p>
<p>Calgary police Chief Mark Neufeld has said that the officer who killed Fiddler was wearing a police-issued, body-worn camera at the time of the killing. No video has been released publicly. Robin Fiddler’s killing is at least the third police-involved death in Calgary in 2019.</p>
<p>The family reports that they are returning Robin Fiddler’s body to Saskatchewan so that the family can lay her to rest and start a traditional healing journey (Laing 2019).</p>

       **<p>A 43-year-old man died on July 1, 2019, after being arrested by Edmonton Police Service officers on June 28. According to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, reports that officers allegedly went to 100 Avenue and 114 Street at around 10:30 PM on June 28 in response to a complaint about a man starting small fires in the area. Police encountered a man and arrested him in a violent takedown.</p>
<p>According to ASIRT, police only determined the man was in medical distress after he was carried to a police van. He was then removed from the van and an ambulance called. The man was taken to hospital, where he died on the evening of July 1.</p>

<p>It has been reported that police were called to the 2000 block of 35th Street SE at around 6 AM in response to a call claiming a “suspicious person” was wandering in and out of backyards in the area. Some interaction took place between the officer and the woman before the victim was shot. Unconfirmed reports suggest the victim used pepper spray during the interaction.</p>
<p>The officer who killed has been described as a female officer with six years in the Calgary Police Service. She has been placed on 30-day paid administrative leave.</p>

<p>The BEI report that provincial police were called to a home in Lavaltrie around 8:20 PM in response to an alleged domestic dispute between a man and a woman. Police removed the man from the home but escorted him back inside to retrieve his wallet and some belongings. According to the BEI, police claim that once inside the man took a knife and injured himself. In response, as is far too typical, an SQ officer shot him and killed him.</p>

According to the BEI, the man ran once police arrived and officers chased him for about 300 meters.</p>
<p>Police allegedly caught up to him near the corner of Ontario and Saint-Timothée streets, where they pepper sprayed, subdued, and handcuffed him. During the takedown and arrest, the man lost consciousness and did not have a pulse. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead there.</p>
<p>The BEI has initially assigned six investigators to the killing. They are also using a forensic expert with the provincial police force (SQ) to assist with the investigation. It is thus not an independent investigation, and police are involved in investigating police.</p>

Police said Thunderblanket then fled on foot and hijacked another vehicle at gunpoint which he used to flee the scene.

A police service dog failed to find him but his body was discovered the following day around 10 a.m. PT in a river and an autopsy was performed.

(CBC)  B.C.'s police watchdog has cleared Port Alberni RCMP of any wrongdoing in connection with an 18-year-old woman who died in 2016 after a night in police custody.  Jocelyn George, a mother of two, was in custody when she was found in medical distress at the Port Alberni RCMP detachment on June 24, 2016.  George was transported from the detachment to Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria where she died of ""drug induced myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) due to the toxic effects of methamphetamine and cocaine,"" according to a report from the Independent Investigation Office (IIO).  George was taken into custody on the morning of June 23, 2016 for being intoxicated in a public space. She was released that afternoon but was taken back into custody that evening after a relative, concerned for her wellbeing, called police.      Family demanding answers after death of Jocelyn George in police custody  The IIO report says the attending officers found the teen ""under the influence of drugs, unaware of her surroundings, and in a delusional state.""  The report goes on to say that while in custody, a senior officer did not make personal visits to the teen — contrary to RCMP policy. It also found said that officer and a guard did not follow instructions to provide her with food and water outside the normal meal times. No criminal conduct found  In his report, the chief civilian director, Ron MacDonald wrote those actions did not rise to the level of criminal conduct.   ""The opinion was that did not have any impact or did not lead to her death. Her death was instead caused by the presence of drugs in her system, she unfortunately had a drug addiction and that impacted her heart and that's what caused her death,"" wrote MacDonald. The IIO concluded there was no criminal wrongdoing on the part of Port Alberni RCMP, 19 months after the death of 18-year-old Jocelyn George. (Facebook)  George was a member of the Ahousaht and Hesquiaht First Nations. The George family representative, Chief Councillor Richard Lucas with the Hesquiaht First Nation, said the family is distraught with the ruling, and feels the teen was discriminated against during her time in the jail cell.  ""Would it have helped if they brought her in earlier?"" Lucas said. ""Those are questions we will never know now.""  In a statement, members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council (NTC) and Hesquiaht First Nation said the outcome is ""deeply disappointing"" and called for a review of police conduct toward Indigenous people. The tribal council oversees the First Nation of which George was a member.   ""This is not the first Nuu-chah-nulth or Indigenous person to die in the custody of the RCMP,"" said the statement.

The young man was reported to be in some distress before being shot by RCMP after apparently minimal engagement. No independent reports or witness statements have been released. Police provided few details even days after the killing. This killing by RCMP once again raises serious concerns about deadly police interactions with people who may be experiencing mental health issues and the quickness of police to deploy lethal force upon encountering people in distress. Initially RCMP reported that an officer had also been shot, leaving the impression that the man they killed may have shot the officer. It was revealed days later (Monday, July 21) that the injured officer had been shot by another RCMP member.</p>
       **<p>On Thursday, July 16, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre (48). McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntrye, who worked as a dishwasher at another local restaurant in Dawson Creek, has been claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre’s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency’s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.</p>
<p>This killing by RCMP has occurred in a context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of “anti-terrorism.”</p>
       **<p>On Friday June 24, 2015, Benjamin “Monty” Robinson (RCMP) was sentenced to two years in prison plus probation and 240 hours of community service for perjury. Eight years earlier, on October 14, 2007, then-corporal Robinson along with three other RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bently, and Kwesi Millington, killed Polish traveler Robert Dziekański at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The unarmed Dziekański had been tasered five times by the officers who also deployed batons and pinned the man to the ground and handcuffed him as he was dying. Robinson, the senior officer in charge during the Dziekański killing, had been convicted of lying to an inquiry examining the events of the killing. A BC Supreme Court judge found Robinson guilty of perjury in June of 2015, ruling that he colluded with the four fellow officers to make up testimony that they presented at the inquiry into Dziekanski’s death.</p>
<p>Immediately following their killing of Dziekański, RCMP made a series of false public statements. They told a story apparently designed to denigrate Dziekański in the public eye and initially claimed he threw things and screamed and yelled after police arrived. It was also suggested that Dziekański was intoxicated. Police also claimed only three officers attended the scene. All of this was contradicted when a bystander video taken by traveler Paul Pritchard came forward. The video showed, contrary to police, that the taser was not used as a last resort but was deployed almost immediately. Police took Pritchard’s video and refused to return it until he brought forward a lawsuit for its return.</p>
<p>Notably, Monty Robinson was also convicted of obstruction of justice in a separate trial after the vehicle he was driving hit and killed a young motorcyclist, Orion Hutchinson (21), in October 2008. In that case Robinson apparently used knowledge gained as a police officer in order to cover up the fact that he had been driving after consuming alcohol. After hitting and killing Robinson left the scene, went home and drank two shots of vodka which he had learned could cover up the fact he had been drinking earlier. Incredibly, Robinson received no jail time in that case, being sentenced to one month of house arrest. Hutchinson’s mother claimed the sentence seemed only like Robinson was being grounded.</p>

He stated to police that he had seen his wife on the balcony, reaching out over the rail to investigate a rattle. Kelly testified she then slipped and fell to her death. At Kelly's trial, the Crown had evidence that he was working with organized crime, namely money laundering. The prosecution experts testified that the great distance between the edifice and the location of Mrs. Kelly's body could have only occurred if she was strongly pushed.[1]  Kelly was arrested for his wife's murder on March 2, 1983. His trial began in April 1984. He was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility after 25 years. The trial was covered extensively by Ontario and Canadian national news outlets. He was imprisoned at the federal inmate intake unit at Millhaven Institution for several years as a security precaution due to his past as an RCMP officer. He was eventually transferred to William Head Institution on Vancouver Island in British Columbia.

Kelly was given parole in May 2010.[2]  In November 2012, Kelly's federal parole was revoked, mainly because he had too many secretive relationships with women.

Where they are charged it us usually for a lesser associated offense. Convictions for any offense related to killing civilians are obviously even less common. On January 27, 2017, a rare conviction of a killer cop was arrived at in a Québec court for a killing almost five years earlier. François Laurin, an officer with Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force was found guilty of dangerous driving causing death in the killing of 25-year-old Éric Rompré.</p>
<p>Officer Laurin was responding to an emergency call on June 16, 2012 when his speeding vehicle slammed into another car on Highway 148 near Papineauville, Québec. The victim in the crash was Éric Rompré the driver of the car hit by Laurin. The officer was travelling at the extreme speed of 180 km/h when he crashed into the victim’s vehicle. Incredibly the dire matter of great public safety and security that had Laurin travelling at such dangerous speed was meeting a colleague on the force to help transport an intoxicated person at Rockfest in nearby Montebello. The Crown in the case questioned why Laurin felt the need to travel at such a high speed for a call of that banal nature.</p>
<p>Laurin’s lawyers tried a common, and often successful ploy, in cases where an officer is actually charged with an offense. They attempted to have the trial set aside because of delays between the filing of charges and the start of court proceedings. In the Canadian context prosecutors have seen the commencement of trials for police stalled leading to the dropping of charges.</p>

The jury determined that he died of natural causes after medical care was delayed, because he was held in jail overnight on the assumption he was drunk.    Coroner's inquests do not determine who was at fault for a death, but they can make recommendations to prevent similar deaths in the future.  Kayuryuk was found unconscious at the landfill in Baker Lake and was taken into custody by RCMP, ""based on some level of assumption and some evidence he was intoxicated,"" the jury's written verdict said.    Over the course of the night, the verdict said three guards monitored Kayuryuk more frequently than normal, ""each with an increasing level of concern,"" because of his unconscious state.  By midday the next day, a medical examination was ordered based on information received from the family and concern from the guards.  Kayuryuk was diabetic and the doctor and nursing staff at the local health centre quickly determined he was experiencing a serious stroke.

<p>RCMP took Kayuryuk into custody after he was found unconscious at the landfill in Baker Lake.  Kayuryuk was observed overnight by three different guards and remained unconscious.

2015-02-17,MR_23,2015-02-17,,,AB,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,25.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Other,,,,,,"<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) the provincial body that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in the province, is quickly developing a reputation for letting cops off on flimsy grounds when they are involved in civilian deaths.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 21, 2017 ASIRT announced that no officers from the Tsuut&#8217;ina Nation Police Service (TNPS) would be charged after a 25-year-old man in police custody apparently killed himself. This despite the fact that the ASIRT investigation found that the force did not follow the “specific protocols [which] were in place” for times when the man, who was known by police, was taken into police custody. According to the ASIRT ruling said “procedural errors” were made and the man was left unsupervised, which protocol said he should not have been “resulting in a sufficient amount of time to commit suicide” (ASIRT).</p>
<p>The man had been arrested on February 17, 2015, supposedly for intoxication and a complaint about his presence at a residence. So once again police were called to address a health care issue and the result is a civilian death.</p>
<p>ASIRT, which has an apparent habit of offering bogus excuses for officers and forces involved in civilian deaths, such as the dubious “excited delirium” claim, this time went one better. Their report attributed the man’s death to the vague and rather unscientific explanation of a “perfect storm” resulting in the man’s death. Surely this is clearly an ideological or copaganda mystification that excuses the officers involved for their own active choices and actions, the committing of procedural errors, and the role those played in contributing to the death. Yet the “perfect storm” means even a consideration of something like negligence is nullified. To the benefit of the police officers responsible.</p>
<p>ASIRT said in a statement that: “This case, however, should remind officers of the duty of care they undertake when exercising custody or control of another person” (ASIRT). Yet there is no mechanism to go beyond the occasional reminder when the investigative body keeps providing excuses to get cops off when civilians die in their custody.</p>
<p>Similarly,  in a statement, Chief Keith Blake of the TNPS said: “The Tsuut’ina Police remain absolutely committed to the highest levels of care for those persons in our care and custody” (Statement). Yet this case shows the lack of commitment to even basic standards of their own protocol. So one might well ask what it is they remain committed too.</p>

2015-04-29,MR_25,2015-04-29,,,AB,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,25.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Altercation,,,,,,"<p>The finding of “excited delirium,” which makes its primary appearance in medical contexts usually only ever as justification for police killings of civilians, is an ideological tool used to excuse lethal police force. It has been used by police forces as a way to simultaneously blame victims for their own killings and give killer cops an answer where no real answer exists.</p>
<p>This dubious piece of copaganda has been offered up once again in Alberta to excuse Edmonton Police Service officers who killed a 25-year-old man on April 29, 2015. This despite well established debunking of the notion of excited delirium. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) offered the excited delirium defense in findings released on April 18, 2017, two years after the young victim died after being subjected to force by multiple officers while in police custody.</p>
<p>Sadly, the victim was targeted by police for the trivial act of supposedly trespassing in the City Centre Mall after nervous security staff called them. The security staff had tweaked to him because they suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So an effort at moral regulation by private security ultimately resulted in a young man having his life taken by police. The ASIRT report added to the moral regulatory approach by suggesting the man had been uncooperative with police, saying he refused to follow directions.</p>
<p>For many police officers refusing to follow directions is an invitation to a beating or worse an extrajudicial execution. In this case ASIRT reports that at least four officers used force on the man supposedly to get him into restraints. After being violently removed from the mall and taken into Downtown Division the man was placed on the floor in the detention area. At this point Edmonton Police Services officers noticed he was unconscious, and in medical distress. Paramedics took the man to hospital but he could not be stabilized and was declared dead there.</p>
<p>Notably, the ASIRT reports makes clear that the man was acting in a way that suggested both to private security and police that his issue was health related not criminal. According to the ASIRT release the man “exhibited bizarre behaviour” (ASIRT). The report continues: “He was observed twisting and attempting to pull away. He was observed to be breathing heavily, mumbling and yelling, mostly incoherently” (ASIRT). Yet the intervention was, once again, repressive violence and thuggish force rather than health care.</p>
<p>This is a case in which private security and police intervene against someone who is, at most, dealing with substance abuse issues. Police should not be intervening in this situation. Yet they do so with force. And when force becomes lethal they turn to “excited delirium” in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable. And it routinely gets them off. And mainstream media repeat the claim uncritically.</p>

2015-09-15,MR_26,2015-09-15,,,BC,,,Unspecified,,James,Christian,McIntosh,,5.0,Male,White,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>How much value does the criminal justice system place on the lives of people killed by police? The general answer is very little. The system that so easily and readily imposes itself on the lives of non-police charged with offenses is less ready to act when the offender is a cop. In the specific case of young victim James Christian McIntosh, only five when struck and killed by RCMP Constable Ace Stewart (49) on September 15, 2015 in Penticton, BC, the courts have determined the value of life at $1500. This is the decision of the court and Justice James Threlfall delivered on January 23, 2017. And this decision is clearly more about the killer being a police officer than any regard for equal application of justice.</p>
<p>Constable Ace Stewart drove into and killed James McIntosh in a proper crosswalk while the boy was out for a walk with his father and brother. Stewart did not slow down or stop his vehicle despite being aware that pedestrians on the street were urging him to do so. He claims he did not know what they meant so he ignored them. Until it was too late. He continued his vehicle even after striking the boy, running over him in the large pickup truck. James McIntosh sustained massive head injuries as a result.</p>
<p>The killing has been devastating for the McIntosh family. Father Brian who was walking with James and as a trained paramedic tried to save his son, has been diagnosed with PTSD. Brother Caleb has been deeply impacted. In the words of mother Elizabeth: “Not only is Caleb struggling with the loss of James, but having witnessed the accident and feeling somehow responsible because he couldn&#8217;t protect James has been a struggle for him” (quoted in Boyd 2017). According to Elizabeth McIntosh since the killing Caleb’s “existence has destabilized” (quoted in Arstad 2017).</p>
<p>In cases where police kill civilians there is invariably an effort in the courts, media, policing institutions, and among police supporters to portray the officer who killed as a victim as much as the person they killed. This played out in the trial of Ace Stewart. Neville McDougal, Stewart’s counsel claimed: “Everyone in this case is a victim” (quoted in Boyd 2017). Never mind that only one person is dead as a result of officer Ace Stewart’s actions, five-year-old James McIntosh.</p>
<p>The favor shown the RCMP constable is clear. According to the lawyer: “The cases clearly say, we are not sentencing you for causing death, we are sentencing you for your momentary inadvertence” (quoted in Mangione 2017). Incredibly the prosecutor, Crown counsel Peter Juk, told the court: “This is not the very worst driving, the very worst set of facts” (quoted in Fries 2017). This is how prosecutors treat police killings of civilians.</p>
<p>Interestingly it seems that officer Stewart’s macho cop identity may have played a role in this horrible situation. Crown counsel Juk noted in his submissions that the vehicle Stewart was driving when he hit James McIntosh, a 2015 Chevy Silverado, had been modified at the Chevrolet dealership to be lifted substantially. The truck was raised more than four inches over its original height. The truck also had wider than average tires. Stewart wanted to be seen as a tough guy on the road.</p>
<p>The judge used Stewart’s macho driving choices as a reason to justify the lenient court decision. According to Threlfall: “The increased height of Constable Stewart&#8217;s truck due to aftermarket modifications increased the truck&#8217;s blind spot area for objects immediately beside or in front of the truck 62 per cent over the original unmodified vehicle” (quoted in Boyd 2017). Yet while prosecutor Juk did argue Stewart’s obligation to drive more, rather than less, carefully given such known consequences of his modification of the truck, this did not seem to play into the judge’s decision. The judge did view the constable’s history of policing favorably in considering the sentence, of course.</p>
<p>Neither did evidence of Constable Ace Stewart’s extensive record of speeding offenses dating back to 1996. Here is another case of a police officer getting away with multiple violations over the course of decades with little to no consequence or accountability until finally these identifiable and documented activities finally lead to the death of a civilian. And even then, the result is a $1500 fine and Constable Ace Stewart is off to drive recklessly again.</p>
<p>The charge of driving a motor vehicle without care and attention under the Motor Vehicle Act could have carried a six-month sentence.</p>

       ***<p>On Tuesday, September 15, 2015, an off-duty RCMP officer was involved in a fatal crash involving a five-year-old boy, James Christian McIntosh, in Penticton, BC. The officer, traveling in his personal vehicle, collided with and killed the young pedestrian around 5 at the  intersection of Fairview Road and Highway 97. McIntosh was out for a bike ride with his father when struck by the officer who was making a right-hand turn in the intersection. Initial reports suggest that McIntosh was using the crosswalk correctly when hit by the officer. The five-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries after being transported to hospital. The officer who killed the boy is a member of the Penticton RCMP detachment and has been placed on administrative leave. The Independent Investigation Office of BC (IIO) has been called in to investigate.</p>
       *<p>In a rare instance in the Canadian state context, charges have been brought against RCMP Constable Ace Jimmy Stewart for the killing of five-year-old James McIntosh in Penticton, British Columbia on September 15, 2015. The charges come following an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency tasked with examining all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, almost a year after James McIntosh was killed. Constable Stewart struck James McIntosh with his vehicle while the child was riding his bike in an intersection along with his father and brother. The officer was off duty at the time. Constable Stewart has been charged with driving without due care and attention, under the Motor Vehicle Act. His first court appearance is scheduled to for October 12, 2016 in Penticton.</p>
<p>While the laying of charges is welcomed by many, and represents an almost unheard of decision in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada, it does not mean a conviction will follow, despite the evidence, as the recent acquittal of killer cop Remo Romano in Ontario shows. It may be the charges came in this case because a child was involved or because the officer was off duty (and thus the force can distance this killing from the formal policing role).</p>

It is rare that they find against officers and rare that they recommend charges befitting the actions of officers. On June 13, 2017 ASIRT announced that they will not recommend charges against Edmonton police officers in the death of a 46-year-old man who died during a rough ride in a police van.</p>
<p>The incident followed the man’s arrest on October 25, 2015. Incredibly, the man had been jumped and held for police by members of the public who believed he had damaged cars in the area in north Edmonton. The man was initially taken to hospital but then released back into police custody. The following day the man was denied bail and was to be returned to the remand centre. Police put him on his back in the prisoner transport van with his legs elevated. Only a few blocks later, Edmonton police officers found the man unresponsive and not breathing.An autopsy later determined that the man died as a result of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Toxicology results found there to be no alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription medications in his bloodstream denying police some version of the “excited delirium” excuse. It turns out they did not need it.</p>

2016-05-15,MR_32,2016-05-15,,,ON,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,18.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, has decided not to recommend charges against a Leeds OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) officer who was involved in a high speed chase in May 2016 that ended in a crash near Smith Falls that killed a teenager in May 2016.</p>
<p>According to the SIU, the officer, who has not been named publicly, saw a vehicle, a Hyundai, allegedly speeding  on County Road 17 and turned around to follow it. With the police pursuit the vehicle turned down a dirt road into trees, killing the 18-year-old male driver. A 16-year-old girl who was a passenger in the front seat was not seriously injured. The SIU report suggests that the speeding car was going 100 km on a stretch of road with speed limits varying between 50 km/h or 80 km/h when the officer saw it, and around 170 km/h when it left the road.</p>
<p>SIU director Tony Loparco, who has rather consistently sided with police officers and forces in cases of harm to civilian since assuming his position, did raise concerns about the officer&#8217;s speed, reporting that  the OPP vehicle reached 165 km/h, and about the fact that the officer did not immediately notify the dispatcher of the pursuit. According to Loparco, each of these may have constituted a breach of the Ontario Police Services Act.</p>
<p>Yet Loparco decided that the officer’s actions did not meet the bar either for dangerous driving or criminal negligence. In his words: “There is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time he interfered with other traffic; additionally the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.”</p>
<p>This is a curious statement given that the teen driver was driving at speeds less than the officer reached at the time the officer began pursuit. So if even the officer’s higher speed and the road conditions did not pose a threat to the public, why pursue a joy riding teen driving at lower speeds under the same conditions?</p>
<p>Loparco went further, suggesting that there was no causal connection between the officer’s pursuit and the crash. In his words: “I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between [the officer’s] actions&#8230;and the single-vehicle collision that caused the&#8230;death.” Yet the stated evidence appears to suggest the teen both sped up and turned off the road in response to the officer’s pursuit and the closing speed of that pursuit.</p>
<p>The SIU assigned eight investigators to the case. Once again it appears the state has protected the state.</p>

2016-07-31,MR_36,2016-07-31,,,AB,,,Unspecified,,Sheldon,Russel,Bentley,,35.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Altercation,,,,,,"<p>This project has been primarily focused on formal, state, policing agencies and officers and their killings of civilians. Yet more and more policing is carried out by private forces, especially security guard services. And like the state policing forces their members kill. Yet private security is largely unregulated in Canada and have much leeway to act in unaccountable and largely unreported ways.</p>
<p>An Edmonton security guard, Sheldon Russell Bentley (35) is currently seeking bail after being charged with manslaughter and robbery for kicking an Edmonton man, Donald Doucette (51), to death and then robbing him.. Doucette, a culinary chef, was found in an alley next to the Lucky 97 grocery store in the afternoon of July 31, 2016. An autopsy showed Doucette died of blunt abdominal trauma.</p>
<p>Doucette had apparently passed out in the alley in before being approached by two security guards, one of whom was Sheldon Bentley. The charges claim Bentley kicked the passed out victim and stole $20 from him. The guards then simply went back to work.</p>
<p>Doucette&#8217;s has been struggling with alcohol for some time, a problem that family members say began in response to the death of his own father. He had been going to Alcoholics Anonymous as well as starting a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In addition Doucette struggled with epilepsy. His family often worried that that he would fall down and have a seizure in a non-supportive environment.</p>
<p>Security guards exist only to protect private property and profits. They have no special mandate to act in public space.</p>
<p>As a range of private security forces take over urban space (from security guards to business association “ambassadors”) more attention must be given to them. And their actions must be increasingly observed and challenged. Some have taken to Cop Watch like counter-patrols of security guards and private security.</p>

2016-08-15,MR_38,2016-08-15,,,AB,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,41.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>Killer cops in Canada rarely face consequences for their actions in Canada. Families of victims are often forced to sue to gain information about the killing of their loved ones or to see police who kill face some process of accountability.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2018, the family of Tracy Janvier (41) launched a civil lawsuit against RCMP Constable Michelle Phillips, the RCMP, and the federal government in the 2016 killing of their loved one. Janvier was run over and killed by Phillips on Alberta Highway 881, about 80 kilometers south of Fort McMurray on August 21, 2016. The suit,  seeking $909,000, claims that Phillips was negligent and speeding, driving recklessly and carelessly when she struck and killed Tracy Janvier. Phillips also struck and injured a 71-year-old man.</p>
<p>Constable Phillips has been charged in the killing. In August 2017 she pleaded not guilty to charges of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing bodily harm. A preliminary hearing was held in June and a trial has been scheduled for April 2019.</p>
       **<p>In the Canadian state context it is exceedingly rare for police who kill civilians to be charged with a criminal offence, no matter how egregious or obviously criminal their actions are. Often times so-called oversight agencies will exonerate the officers (sometimes because they do not receive full or proper disclosure from obstructionist forces or police associations, as the Ontario Ombudsperson has reported). In other cases the Crown will operate to shield officers who kill by refusing to bring charges even where the oversight agency has found evidence of wrongdoing by police. By refusing to bring charges the Crown acts to protect killer police officers from having to defend their actions in court and foreclosing even the possibility of conviction. The decision to withhold charges also deprives the public, and family members of the victim, from learning the identity of the officers responsible as the bringing of charges is often the only mechanism by which the identities of killer police officers are revealed publicly. Given the close associations and mutual professional benefits of positive relations between police and prosecutors (and the more straightforward interest of the state in defending its own operators) the choice of prosecutors not to charge police even in cases of apparent wrongdoing is not overly surprising.</p>
<p>Yet it is still disappointing particularly for friends and family members of victims and for community advocates. Another such disappointing case of prosecutorial shielding of police came out of Alberta on August 22, 2016 when the Crown prosecutor chose not to bring charges against the officers who killed Anthony Heffernan (27) in 2015, despite the fact that the provincial oversight body, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), found evidence of police wrongdoing through their investigation. Incredibly, the officer who killed Anthony Heffernan has since gone on to kill another man, Dave McQueen, a man in a wheelchair, in 2016. Tellingly the killing of Anthony Heffernan was the closest any police officer has come to being criminally charged for killing someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die Policing Again: The Killing of Anthony Heffernan</p>
<p>Anthony Heffernan was a young man experiencing addiction and mental health issues who was shot multiple times and killed by police despite the fact that he was confined to a room in a Super 8 motel and posed no immediate danger to anyone but perhaps himself. Heffernan suffered three shots to the neck and head. The ASIRT report found that police could Heffernan through the partially opened hotel room door and they described him as “flushed, non-responsive and hyperventilating” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Police described the victim as being “in medical distress” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016) but there is no proper explanation as to why the response of officers was to shoot someone in distress, and confined to an enclosed space, multiple times. Heffernan was only holding a “small diabetic needle” with no point on it and a lighter. The entire incident lasted only 72 seconds. In that short amount of time police encountered, engaged, and killed a young man in distress and confined to a room.</p>
<p>This appears to be yet another case of “comply or die” policing in which someone is killed simply because they do not fulfill the authoritarian wishes of officers shouting commands. Indeed, in this case officers asserted that they shot Heffernan because he did not comply with their orders to drop the needle and lighter. A steep price to pay, summary execution, for failing to satisfy the authoritarian desires of police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Protecting State</p>
<p>The ASIRT report said that although “there is evidence capable of providing reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or offences have been committed, the Crown opinion has determined that the case does not meet the standard for prosecution” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016). The family finds this twist of logic to be “shocking.”</p>
<p>To excuse their decision not to bring charges the Crown prosecutors, perhaps trying to defuse criticism of their controversial choice released a lengthy statement. It read in part:</p>
<p>“The evidence would be that he did so as a defensive action against an individual who was armed with a syringe, and who had been either unwilling or unable to comply with police directions.</p>
<p>“In all of these circumstances, it could not be disproven that the subject officer acted upon a reasonable belief that he and the other officers were at risk of serious or grievous bodily harm, and that his use of force was necessary.” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calgary Chief of Police Roger Chaffin responded by saying he stands by his officer despite noting that he has been reassigned while working “through his own, particular issues” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Notably the Chief of Police in Calgary has been so concerned with improper behavior in the force that he has gone on a public witch hunt against whistleblowers in the department who have spoken out against misconduct or named officers involved.</p>
<p>The lawyer for the Heffernan family, Tom Engel, notes that the officer involved in the shooting exercised his right to remain silent during the ASIRT investigation and refused even to give the police oversight agency his notes. This is an incredible privilege given police but denied civilians. It is one reason among many that so-called independent oversight agencies have been so ineffectual (or effective in shielding police) in every provincial context within the Canadian state. Notably, again, not bringing charges protects the officers from having to testify and hand over their notes so the Crown, even in this way, is protecting the officers from necessary public scrutiny regardless of a conviction or not.</p>
<p>The family is planning a civil suit against the police. This is often the last resort option to which families must turn simply to learn the names of officers involved in killing their loved one. In this case the family is hoping that the civil suit against Calgary Police Services and the officers who were in the Super 8 motel room will have to testify and turn over the notes. According to Tom Engel: “It just seemed that, with all those police officers in the room with all that fire power &#8230; [Anthony] was shot having nothing but a lighter in his hand and possibly approaching the officers, it’s a stretch to say it was a justifiable homicide” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016).</p>
<p>Engel also points out the double standard that exists because officers are allowed to stay silent and keep their notes under the Police Act. Indeed officers are rarely if ever arrested when they kill someone, even under dubious circumstances. In Engel’s view:</p>
<p>“If the tables were reversed and Anthony Heffernan had killed a police officer, they would have arrested him on the spot and had him in for an intensive interrogation trying to break down his will to remain silent. But that’s not the case with a police officer, they don’t arrest him, they carry on an investigation for months or even years.” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016)</p>
<p>In the case of a civil suit or fatality inquiry the officers would be compelled to testify and would have to turn over the notes. The officers were the only witnesses to the killing and their stories about what happened actually differed in key areas such as the movements of Heffernan before he was shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone in Contact with Police is at Tremendous Risk: the Family Responds</p>
<p>The family was devastated by the Crown decision. Given the circumstances around the killing of Anthony Heffernan they expected the bringing of a rare charge of murder against the officer responsible (who would kill again earlier this year). Anthony Heffernan&#8217;s mother, Irene, had hoped “clear and just thinking would prevail, but it didn’t” (quoted in 2016). Heffernan’s father Pat says his son’s killing shows that people are at risk any time they come into contact with police. In his words: “It’s a sad day for all Albertans and Canadians alike. There is no justice in this case. Anthony is dead, and anyone else who comes into contact with police is at tremendous risk &#8230; because they [officers] are going to be supporting each other in whatever needs to be said” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016).</p>
<p>This is another case that begs us to ask deeper questions about why police are called in the first place. It raises the effects of social isolation and moral panics, around drug use or mental health, which lead people to call police for behavior that is not harming anyone but may be unusual or disturbing. This is a matter manufactured fear and dependence on authorities. And it ends with someone dead at the hands of police upset that their orders have not been obeyed and trained to shoot first, second, and always. And knowing they will not be held accountable for the great harm they do, for the lives they destroy.</p>

One of those rare cases involves Alberta RCMP Constable Michelle Phillips. The constable has pleaded not guilty to two charges in the killing of 41-year-old Indigenous person Tracy Janvier on August 21, 2016. In June 2017, one count of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. Constable Phillips was charged with  The killer cop was not present in court when the pleas were entered by a lawyer on August 30, 2017. A preliminary inquiry is scheduled to be held in June 2018.</p>
<p>The charges came after an investigation by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province. ASIRT concluded Janvier died as a result of being struck and killed by an RCMP vehicle traveling at “an extremely high rate of speed.” Constable Phillips had been responding to a call about an accident on the road in which Janivier, who had been struck by a previous vehicle, was being tended to by a 71-year-old man. Constable Phillips hit both the injured Janvier and the 71-year-old caregiver with her police vehicle at high speed.</p>

2016-08-25,MR_40,2016-08-25,,,QC,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,81.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>The police oversight agency for the province of Québec, the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), will now investigate a car crash from August 2016 in which a Gatineau police car collided with a vehicle driven by an 81-year-old man. The decision comes after the man died in hospital on Monday, October 17, almost two months after being injured.</p>
<p>The BEI reports that the Gatineau officer driving the police vehicle was responding to a call when he crashed into a car driven by the 81-year-old man on August 25, 2016. The man was hospitalized for several days before being transferred to a respite care center. It was there that he would die. This is already the 14th case investigated by the BEI since they became operational in June of 2016.</p>
       **<p>A 41-year-old man was shot and killed by officers of the Québec provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), on Friday, August 26, 2016. The killing took place in the town of St-Cyrille-de-Wendover, near Drummondville, about 115 kilometers northeast of Montréal after two SQ officers apparently responded to a call at approximately 9:45 PM. Police report that the man and a woman, who apparently were in a non-marital relationship, had supposedly argued over ownership of a cell phone. The woman was said to be in a neighbor’s house at the time police arrived. Police have also reported that when they arrived the man was holding a knife. Neighbors have reported hearing two shots fired. The woman’s eight-year-old daughter and father were also at the scene.</p>
<p>Six investigators with the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the Bureau of Independent Investigators, which investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Québec, are investigating the killing of the as yet unnamed victim. Notably, and alarmingly, the Montréal police department is also working on the investigation. This violate principles of independence and autonomy in investigations of police wrongdoing and once more involves police investigating police (or interfering with investigations of police).</p>

2016-09-03,MR_41,2016-09-03,,,ON,,,Unspecified,,Chokah,,Bayez,,20.0,Male,Middle Eastern,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>As this project has detailed repeatedly police across Canada act largely as they wish in investigations into the harms they inflict on civilians. This includes not even reporting those harms.</p>
<p>In September of 2016 a Hamilton police officer was involved in a vehicular pursuit that killed 20-year-old motorcyclist Chokha Bayez. Yet the Hamilton police broke the law and never reported the killing by the officer to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) as they are required to do. Every police service in Ontario is legally mandated to notify the SIU immediately of any incidents of serious injury, allegations of sexual assault, or death involving their officers (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>An SIU investigation into the Hamilton police killing of Bayez was only initiated when the victim’s family contacted the unit a month after the crash. This is an unacceptable delay that further serves to interfere with any proper investigation. As judge Michael Tulloch put it is his report on oversight in Ontario: ”In most cases, the SIU depends on the police notifying it of incidents within its mandate. Prompt, thorough police notification is the starting point for effective, efficient SIU investigations. If the police take too long to notify the SIU of an incident, or fail to do so at all, any investigation may be compromised and justice may not ever be done” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the investigation is not even listed on a Hamilton police report of SIU investigations presented to the police board earlier in April 2017 (Carter 2017). Constable Steve Welton told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that the incident was included (despite saying he could not comment on the case and failure to report to the SIU). Oddly, according to the CBC, no vehicular death can be found in the police board report (Carter 2017). CBC News only became aware of the SIU investigation as a result of a freedom of information request listing all of the SIU&#8217;s investigations into Hamilton police officers from 2016 (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>As we have documented consistently in this project there is no proper independent oversight of police and no mechanism is used, legal or otherwise, to ensure there are any negative consequences for officers and police forces who fail to comply with investigative policy and requirements. Even where they violate or flaunt the law.</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon told CBC News: “If the SIU Director is of the view that there may have been a breach of the regulation, and no charges are laid, it has been the Director&#8217;s practice to notify the Chief/Commissioner of his concerns in order that they may be reviewed” (quoted in Carter 2017). Of course the chief is under no obligation to act and it is unsure if such notice has even been given in this case.</p>
<p>André Marin, a former Ontario ombudsman and past SIU director, is clear in stating that under current conditions there is nothing to stop police from acting like this whenever they so choose. In his words: “Because there are no consequences, police can be extremely lax. They have proven themselves to be ungovernable” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Marin has a stark assessment of police services boards as well. In his view, while they could push for oversight:  “Police services boards should be vigilant and hold their feet to the fire — but they don’t care either. There is absolutely no excuse for this” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Again, the police are a law unto themselves. And the state always protects the state.</p>

       ***<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, “panicked” during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.</p>
<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion’s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion’s story conflicted both with Adoyta’s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya’s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man’s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he “sort of panicked” and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion’s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the “manner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta’s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta’s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept” (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: “This is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta” (quoted in Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.</p>
<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled “gun” around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.</p>
<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted “evidence.” So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion’s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.</p>

2016-09-16,MR_43,2016-09-16,,,MB,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,,Female,Unspecified,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>A woman has been killed when the van she was a passenger in collided with a pickup truck and rolled over during pursuit by Winnipeg police on Boyd Avenue near Sinclair Street in the Burrow’s neighborhood. The crash occurred on September 13, 2016. The victim was one of five people, including another woman, two men, one of whom was the driver, and a 17-year-old boy, who were in the silver van that crashed following initiation of police pursuit. The four other occupants of the van are in stable condition in local hospital. The driver of the pickup truck was also in hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>According to Winnipeg police spokesperson Constable Rob Carver, whose statements have not been independently confirmed: “The incident appears to have started when a general patrol unit in the area observed the vehicle with five individuals in it and decided that there was a reason to initiate a traffic stop. Overhead lights were activated and … the vehicle immediately fled and collided with the half-ton” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Curiously Carver went on to suggest that “[w]hile it is a pursuit by a technical definition, we did not actually apparently pursue the vehicle” (quoted in CBC News 2016). However, a short pursuit is still actually apparently a pursuit nonetheless. And in this case one with fatal consequences. No other details have been released by police or independent witnesses. Police have not revealed why they decided to pursue the vehicle in the first place.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which examines all incidents of harm to civilians by on-duty and off-duty officers in Manitoba, is investigating this incident which resulted in the death of the woman passenger. The victim has not yet been named publicly.</p>

One victim who died during some type of struggle with an officer on October 12 has been identified as Russell Spence (31) of Winnipeg. Spence was involved in some sort of altercation with an officer during processing at the remand center. He became unresponsive at the center and was transferred to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Names of victims have typically not been released by authorities but the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation learned of Spence’s identity on October 26. His family has come forward asking for information about the specific circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Russell Spence has been described as friendly and harmless. In the words of his older brother Kevin Bittern: “Russell was a friendly giant. All his friends and everyone knew he would not hurt anybody, or start anything. I find this very suspicious about his death” (quoted in Taylor 2016). Bittern does not believe Spence was resisting because of the man’s previous experiences in dealing with police. He is upset that the family has been kept in the dark about the killing of their loved one. The family is seeking legal assistance and attempting to piece together Russell Spence’s last hours outside. They are looking for any witnesses to the police intervention against the victim.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba, is investigating the death because the struggle was with either a police officer or a corrections officer. The IIU has not revealed which force the officer belonged to. There has been no comment from Winnipeg Police Service.</p>

       ***<p>A man died following a struggle with police while being processed at the Winnipeg Remand Center on Wednesday, October 12, 2016. The man suffered some sort of medical emergency during the struggle and became unresponsive. He was transported by ambulance to the Health Sciences Centre and died while in hospital.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, the agency that investigates incidents of harm to civilians by police in Winnipeg, sent investigators to the scene directly. Manitoba Corrections is also investigating and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has been notified.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Remand Centre is already the site of local controversy with Manitoba Corrections under fire over the death of Errol Greene earlier in 2016. Greene’s family has maintained that Greene was epileptic and did not have access to his medications over the course of several days. The family has criticized officials for not providing proper details about what happened to their loved one. They are still not clear whether Greene died at the remand center itself or some time later in hospital. The family called for a public inquest into his death in August but the government has still not agreed to this reasonable request.</p>

2016-11-07,MR_49,2016-11-07,,,ON,,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,94.0,Female,Unspecified,,,,Vehicle,,,,,,"<p>A police chase in downtown Brantford, Ontario, on Monday, November 7, 2016, ended in a the death of a 94-year-old woman after a car being chased by police crashed into the vehicle in which she was a passenger. The victim was taken to Brantford General Hospital where she was pronounced dead. The driver of her vehicle sustained numerous fractures. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, the chase started as police attempted to stop a vehicle beginning around 10:30 AM. The crash occurred at 10:40 AM.</p>
<p>Incredibly this crash occurred at the intersection of Colborne Street West and Gilkison Street, the same intersection at which a police car chase ended with the death of an innocent third party. On October 10, 2014, Ashley Lerno, 18, of Brantford, was killed as a result of a police chase when the vehicle she was driving was hit by another vehicle driven by Richard Gamble, 50, who was being chased by Brant County OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) officers for trying to avoid a RIDE, drinking and driving, check. The two officers in that case, Constable Craig McMurtrie and Constable Rod Grubb, have been charged, in a situation rarely faced by police whose actions result in deaths to civilians, with criminal negligence causing death. Their trial is slated to start on March 20, 2017.</p>
<p>Once again it must be asked for how long such actions by police in pursuit of issues like this that result in deaths of innocent and uninvolved people will be tolerated. These are too frequent results of police chases for matters of less grave significance.</p>
       **<p>A 31-year-old Toronto man has died after police shot him with a conducted energy weapon. The man went into medical distress after being tased and was taken to hospital where he later died. Police had apparently responded to a 911 call from a home on Sages Crescent near Old Weston Road and St. Clair Avenue in the city’s west end on the afternoon of Friday, November 4, 2016.</p>
<p>Several Toronto Police Department officers arrived at the home where some type of interaction with the victim was said to have happened. While police claim the man was holding two knives and screaming (neither of which is necessarily threatening), the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has not confirmed that the man was in any way armed. They have also not confirmed the presence of any weapons at the scene other than those held by police. A conflicting report said the man was simply walking with one knife.</p>
<p>The SIU, which investigates cases of harm to civilians by police in Ontario, announced its decision to investigate the killing at around 2 PM on Friday afternoon. Six investigators along with two forensic investigators will carry out the investigation.</p>

2016-11-12,MR_51,2016-11-12,,,BC,Prince George,455 Victoria St,V2L 0B7,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,,Male,Indigenous,,,,Unspecified,,,,,,"<p>In northern British Columbia a trip to the RCMP detachment can be a death sentence. Too many people taken into custody by RCMP, particularly in northern detachments do not leave again alive. Disconcertingly, many of the people arrested and detained in northern communities are targeted and picked up for nothing more than public intoxication. Disproportionately arrested and detention for public intoxication are imposed on poor people and Indigenous people at discretion of police. Unfortunately such a situation has happened once again in the norther city of Prince George as a man has died in custody during the early morning hours of November 21, 2016.</p>
<p>The victim was arrested earlier in the evening of the 20th for supposedly causing a disturbance while intoxicated. He arrested for public drunkenness and transported to the Prince George RCMP detachment. At around 2 AM the man was found unresponsive. Emergency Health Services were contacted and RCMP officers apparently initiated CPR. A bit before 3 AM the man was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office, the agency that investigates incidents of civilian harm involving police has sent investigators to Prince George to examine the death. The name and background of the deceased man have not been released publicly.</p>
       **<p>Vancouver Police Department officers have killed a man at a Canadian Tire store in East Vancouver on the afternoon of November 10, 2016. A police officer shot and killed the man after two officers responded to a call at the Canadian Tire at Grandview Highway and Bentall Street. Police claim a robbery was in process when they arrived. A second man was taken into custody. Few details have yet been released.</p>
       **<p>There is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.</p>
<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:</p>
<p>“As of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.” (IIO 2016)</p>
<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: “They are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.” (quoted in Kurjata 2016)</p>
<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.</p>
<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law—they are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.</p>
<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a “weapon” rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after</em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.</p>
<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:  “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that…it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Kurjata 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post</em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:</p>
<p>“Our message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it’s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.” (quoted in Humphreys 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.</p>

<p>The officer turned on his cruiser’s lights and sirens in a an attempt to stop a Nissan after two men entered it from a house where an assault suspect was believed to be. Notably, the officer did not know one of the men was the suspect. In response to the officer’s actions the driver of the Nissan accelerated to try to get away, drove into an intersection, and collided head-on with a Honda, in which the two seniors were passengers.

<p>The 94-year-old became unresponsive at the scene before paramedics arrived and was pronounced dead at hospital. The 71-year-old passenger suffered a broken sternum, a broken bone in her back, and two broken bones in her left hand.</p>
<p>The SIU reports that it was only after the driver was arrested that he realized it was the assault suspect. That raises questions about why the officer undertook the actions taken. As well it might have been assumed that the lights and sirens would provoke a response as the car was leaving a residence and it was not a routine traffic stop. The SIU did conclude that it was the officer’s actions that led to the collision but still decided to let him off.</p>
<p>Said SIU director Tony Loparco in his report: “I find that there is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway.” But clearly his actions did create a danger to others in the roadway as one person was left dead and another badly injured as a result. According to Loparco, the officer “was concerned that might cause a situation dangerous to the public.” Which it obviously did.</p>

       **<p>The Independent Investigations Unit (IIU), the oversight body that examines police killings of civilians in Manitoba, is investigating after police killed a man they had taken into custody in the evening of February 12, 2017. Winnipeg police officers attended a home in Garden City after supposedly receiving reports of a disturbance there in the late evening. One man in the house said he wanted another man removed from the residence and police took the other man into custody to remove him. According to police some type of struggle ensured and the prisoner was injured fatally. Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Services was contacted and the victim was taken to Seven Oaks Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Independently confirmed details of the killing have not been released publicly. Neither has the name of the victim.</p>

       <p>The family of influential artist Moses Amik Beaver is demanding answers after their loved one was found dead in his cell at the Thunder Bay Jail on Monday, February 13, 2017. The 59-year-old Beaver struggled with mental health issues and those close to him want to know why he was being held in jail and not a health care facility. Jails in Canada are too often used by the state as holding centers for Indigenous people in need of health care not punishment, even well after health care issues have been identified.</p>
<p>Local Indigenous leaders, including Johnny Yellowhead, chief of the Nibinamik (Summer Beaver) band in northwestern Ontario, where Moses Beaver’s family lived has called for a full public examination into Beaver’s death and what might have been done to help him. He could not say why Beaver was in custody but reported that he had expressed concern about depression and blackouts.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement released Thursday, February 16, 2017, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski First Nation said:</p>
<p>“The sudden and unexplained death of Moses Beaver was devastating to his family and everyone in Nibinamik. For Moses to die under these circumstances is troubling on so many levels, especially as his death has not been officially acknowledged by those responsible for his care. We are doing everything possible to support Chief and Council and the family of Moses Beaver, and we will demand an investigation into the circumstances around his passing.” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Said Chief Yellowhead: “Our dear friend Moses Beaver had struggled for many years with mental health issues but we do not understand why he was in custody or the circumstances that led to his death. It is clear that Moses needed professional help and a psychiatric assessment, and we demand to know why this didn’t happen” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay art gallery owner JP Fraser remembers the artists whose work his gallery has featured: “He was a very gentle person. He was a very warm, welcoming, outgoing and caring man. His painting skills will be a great loss to the artistic community. And what a waste of a life. He should have had treatment” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Fraser identified the Thunder Bay Jail as the wrong place to hold someone with mental illness (a fact clear to many except police it seems). In his view: “It is just not a place for someone with mental-health issues” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a). One issue that emerges in city after city in Canada is that mental health services and funding are insufficient while police budgets continue to increase even as crime rates drop.</p>

       ***<p>The woman killed by Toronto police on January 2, 2017 has been identified as Amleset Haile. The 60 year-old native of Ethiopia was living at a home on St. Clarens Avenue, a Houselink home for people with mental health and addiction issues, when police killed her. Amleset Haile’s name has only been released publicly now. While the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency responsible for investigating cases of civilians harmed by police in Ontario, is investigating the killing it has not released her name.</p>
<p>Police arrived at the home near Bloor and Lansdowne Streets in west Toronto at 4:45 AM on January 2 in response to a report of an emotionally distraught woman threatening suicide. Only 15 minutes later, about 5 AM, Amleset Haile was wheeled out on a stretcher, not moving, her neck held in a brace. The woman would die two  days later in hospital after being taken off of life support.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered in the month following her death at the hands of police. And family, friends, and neighbors want answers. Among the questions are why a home for people with mental health issues sis not have trained staff available to assist a distraught woman. Another question concerns why such a home would call police first rather than health care providers. Other questions involve what exactly police did to the woman and why and how did she sustain severe trauma to her body within 15 minutes of police activity. The SIU has not confirmed any police claims about the incident.</p>
<p>Friend Jennifer Cox witnessed part of the incident and believes Haile was in fear and running from police. She does not believe the frail woman was strong enough to lift herself up to jump from a window or balcony. Cox, like others, wonders if the situation involving her friend could have ended differently had a mental health caregiver  been called and responded instead of police.</p>
<p>The Toronto Police Department does have Mobile Crisis Intervention Teams (MCIT), roving units made up of a specially trained police officer and a mental-health nurse. Despite repeated recommendations and calls coming from coroner’s inquests these crisis teams are not available 24-hours a day. And none are available between 11 PM and 6 AM, what can be desperate overnight hours.</p>
<p>In the view of Steve Lurie, executive director of the Toronto branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, there should be an expansion of hours of specialized mental health units. As he puts it: “If the call was ‘we think someone is suicidal,’ it makes more sense to bring mental health professionals to bear if they are available” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p>
<p>On the whole far more resources should be put into independent mental health sources and resources in cities across Canada. Yet public funding is overwhelmingly given to police departments, at the expense of mental health care, harm reduction, support services, health care services for poor people, etc. Police departments continue to  make up the greatest part of city budgets while mental health funding and resources are slashed.</p>
<p>Amleset Haile is remembered by friends and the community organizations she was active in as generous, caring, and kind. She contributed to her communities through groups like Houselink and Sistering, a group for homeless and poor women in Toronto.</p>

       *<p>The family of influential artist Moses Amik Beaver is demanding answers after their loved one was found dead in his cell at the Thunder Bay Jail on Monday, February 13, 2017. The 59-year-old Beaver struggled with mental health issues and those close to him want to know why he was being held in jail and not a health care facility. Jails in Canada are too often used by the state as holding centers for Indigenous people in need of health care not punishment, even well after health care issues have been identified.</p>
<p>Local Indigenous leaders, including Johnny Yellowhead, chief of the Nibinamik (Summer Beaver) band in northwestern Ontario, where Moses Beaver’s family lived has called for a full public examination into Beaver’s death and what might have been done to help him. He could not say why Beaver was in custody but reported that he had expressed concern about depression and blackouts.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement released Thursday, February 16, 2017, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski First Nation said:</p>
<p>“The sudden and unexplained death of Moses Beaver was devastating to his family and everyone in Nibinamik. For Moses to die under these circumstances is troubling on so many levels, especially as his death has not been officially acknowledged by those responsible for his care. We are doing everything possible to support Chief and Council and the family of Moses Beaver, and we will demand an investigation into the circumstances around his passing.” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Said Chief Yellowhead: “Our dear friend Moses Beaver had struggled for many years with mental health issues but we do not understand why he was in custody or the circumstances that led to his death. It is clear that Moses needed professional help and a psychiatric assessment, and we demand to know why this didn’t happen” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay art gallery owner JP Fraser remembers the artists whose work his gallery has featured: “He was a very gentle person. He was a very warm, welcoming, outgoing and caring man. His painting skills will be a great loss to the artistic community. And what a waste of a life. He should have had treatment” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Fraser identified the Thunder Bay Jail as the wrong place to hold someone with mental illness (a fact clear to many except police it seems). In his view: “It is just not a place for someone with mental-health issues” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a). One issue that emerges in city after city in Canada is that mental health services and funding are insufficient while police budgets continue to increase even as crime rates drop.</p>
<p>This point is emphasized by Johnny Yellowhead: “I wish there was better health care. He wanted to get better. He asked me to help” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay Police and jail officials have refused to comment on either why Beaver was being held in custody or on the circumstances of his death. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services confirmed that there was a death in the jail on Monday but would not say more.</p>
<p>The Thunder Bay Jail is already quite notorious in the Canadian context. It is the very facility where Indigenous youth Adam Capay (23) was held in solitary confinement for more than four years before public pressure pushed provincial authorities to change his conditions.</p>
<p>Moses Amik Beaver painted in the vivid Woodlands style associated with Ojibwe artist Norval Morrisseau. He was well known for his depictions of spirits and animals, painted in vivid colors and outlined in black. He was also very much appreciated for his work with children in local schools.</p>

       **<p>The killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year old Somali Canadian man, by Ottawa Police Constable Daniel Montsion on July 24, 2016, was a particularly vicious and brutal affair which sparked community outrage and a community movement for “Justice for Abdirahman.” Montsion repeatedly delivered heavy baton blows to the defenseless man. On Monday March 6, 2017 Ontario’s police oversight agency, the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) brought three charges against Constable Montsion: manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon. Laying of charges against police officers who kill civilians is a too rare outcome in Canada.</p>
<p>The lethal beating of Abdi, a man struggling with mental health issues, while neighbors called out for the officers to stop was partially caught on video. Neighbors looked out for Abdi who was well known in the community and informed officers of his mental health issues and likely fear and lack of understanding of police commands. They implored officers to back off the frightened man but the assault with baton persisted. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the following day but family members say hospital officials told them the man was dead forty-five minutes before he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is a member of the Ottawa police direct action response team (DART) which targets gang but was assisting on patrol when he killed Abdi. Montsion has been on desk duty throughout the investigation and is now scheduled to appear at the Ontario court of justice in Ottawa on March 29. A second officer, Constable Dave Weir was involved in the assault on Abdi but the SIU concluded he was only a witness officer.</p>
<p>As reported previously by killercopscanada Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having a history of violence against Somali-Canadians. By his own admission he had “panicked” when faced with a suspect of Somali background in a case that might also have included the planting of evidence by police.</p>
<p>The police assault on Abdi began with a 911 call from a Bridgehead coffee shop in Abdi’s neighborhood in Ottawa. What happened there is still unclear but owner Tracey Clark says Abdi had made some customers feel uncomfortable or harassed. In her words:</p>
<p>“He would stand and stare at customers, or get a little bit too close, and we were beginning to hear from customers that it was making them feel uncomfortable. And so we had started to have those conversations where, ‘Are you aware of this behaviour, could we ask you not to do that?’ So there were some interventions like that that had taken place.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>After leaving the coffee shop Abdi apparently attempted to return to his apartment three blocks away. On the way he was intercepted by police. One witness, Ross McGhie reports that Abdi appeared fearful of receiving baton blows from the officer who clearly held a baton, and as a result picked up a piece of foam from the street (Nease and Pritchard 2017). He held it over his head in a defensive, not offensive, posture.</p>
<p>At some point, at the corner of Wellington and Hilda streets near Abdi’s apartment, the first officer tried to grab Abdi who dropped the foam and tried to run to his apartment building on Hilda Street. The officer prevented this by striking Abdi a few times on his legs, arms and upper body according to the witness Ross McGhie (Rease and Pritchard 2017). The officer also shouted at the stricken man.</p>
<p>At that point a second officer, said to be Constable Montsion, arrived on scene in a cruiser. He apparently moved very quickly and aggressively against the victim. In the words of McGhie: “The officer emerged from that car very rapidly &#8230; pulled up right in front of the building &#8230; immediately jumped into the altercation and administered a number of very heavy blows to the head and face and neck of Mr. Abdi” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family lawyer Lawrence Greenspon noted that family members had to endure much during the lengthy SIU investigation. In his words:</p>
<p>“It’s been extremely difficult. You not only have the incredible grief that we really can’t understand unless we go through it ourselves, and I don’t wish that on anybody. You have this grief of losing a son, brother, and it’s magnified … the public light has been shining on this death, this tragedy, for eight months now.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 20017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenspon said that the family would likely be pursuing a civil lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>The SIU report is with Ontario&#8217;s attorney general, at present Ottawa Centre Member of  Provincial Parliament Yasir Naqvi but it is not clear if Naqvi will make the report public or not. This has been a case of great public interest and concern. More than is often the case in situations involving police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi was the focus of important public mobilizations and campaigns, including mobilizations of “Black Lives Matter.” Large demonstrations calling for “Justice for Abdirahman” were held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. #justiceforabdirahman gained much attention on social media.</p>

       **<p>The Ottawa police tactical officer who shot and killed Raymond Alliman (31) in the morning of June 3, 2017 has been identified as Constable Aaron Reichert. Reichert fired nine shots at Alliman, hitting the man in the head and killing him, in a parking garage after pursuing Alliman from the city’s Byward Market. Alliman was suspected of shooting two men and killing one.</p>
<p>In May, 2018, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, cleared Reichert of any wrongdoing in the killing of Raymond Alliman. The SIU reported that only 76 seconds passed from Reichert’s first radio dispatch saying he thought he had heard a gunshot (with no suspect identified) to the constable telling dispatch about a second shooting. The SIU report suggests that Alliman had opportunities to fire at Reichert but did not. Alliman was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
       **<p>Andrew Loku was shot and killed by a Toronto police officer on July 5, 2015. On Monday June 5, 2017 a coroner’s inquest opened into the killing. An autopsy found that Loku had been shot twice in the chest. He died of the gunshot wounds at the scene. The killing raised deeply troubling questions about the rapidity of police use of force, anti-Black racism on the Toronto force, and police mistreatment of people who may need mental health supports. Loku’s killing by the still unnamed officer sparked demonstrations by community members and Black Lives Matter movements.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old father of five, originally from South Sudan where he suffered kidnapping and torture, was confronted by two Toronto officers in the hallway of an apartment building on Gilbert Avenue near Rogers Road and Caledonia Road in the city’s west end. Following the killing there were calls to identify the officers involved and charge them and to release video footage of the interaction and shooting. As one close friend of Andrew Loku, Kiden Jonathan, who had been with his friend hours before he was killed, has said publicly: “We had a lot of questions, and we didn’t have any answers about what happened that night” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Calls for an inquest in the killing of Andrew Loku have come from many different sources. These include members of Loku’s family, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the African Canadian Legal Clinic, Alok Mukherjee, former chair of the Toronto Police Service Board, and Black Lives Matter Toronto.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest into Loku’s killing will be presided over by coroner Dr. John Carlisle. Several community groups have sought participant status in the inquest. They include the CMHA, the Black Action Defence Committee, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Empowerment Council, and Across Boundaries, a groups provides support and services to racialized communities dealing with mental health issues (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Accountability: A Flawed SIU Investigation</p>
<p>While there should be no illusions about the coroner’s inquest, and its limited scope of action, it is hoped that the inquest will provide some answers to serious questions about Andrew Loku’s killing. These include the identities of the two officers directly involved.</p>
<p>The officer who killed Loku had already been exonerated by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines police harm to civilians in Ontario, in March 2016. The SIU declared the shooting “legally justified,” a typical response to police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>This decision drew outrage from community members, policing critics, and Black Lives Matter organizers. A space in front of Toronto Police Headquarters was occupied following the decision to clear the officer who killed Loku. Black Lives Matter Toronto held the space for 15 days in protest against ongoing racism, lack of transparency, and lack of accountability in both policing and oversight. Community members also held a vigil outside the home of Premier Kathleen Wynne, head of provincial government.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the SIU claim that the officer who killed Loku was worried about a hammer Loku was said to be holding, evidence suggests another story. Steve Lurie, Executive Director of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Toronto, has called for the inquest based on evidence that contradicts the SIU and police story. In his words: “We have evidence that Andrew was calm at the time of his shooting” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Two issues call into question the conclusions of the SIU. First is the actual account of an eye witness who has said that Loku did not pose any threat to anyone at the time of his killing. According to Loku’s neighbor, Robin Hicks, who witnessed the police killing: “Andrew died right in front of me. There was no reason for it” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Second are the serious questions about surveillance video from the shooting.  According to police and the SIU, the video cameras at the scene were not functioning that night, and, even more curious, cut out right in the crucial moment before Loku is shot by the officer (Gillis 2017a). The video that does exist apparently shows Loku moving very slowly with the hammer down at his side, his behavior in no way threatening.</p>
<p>As troubling is the fact that Immediately after the shooting, a Toronto police officer tried to review and download the video (Gillis 2017a). Incredibly, this is activity that even the SIU called “improper” yet they did not probe this further in their investigation. This is more evidence of the ongoing, and unpunished, practices of police to interfere with, obstruct, and predetermine the SIU investigations. The SIU have themselves long documented and complained about such practices but there are no mechanisms used to make police comply with investigative policies and procedures (legal mechanisms ate available but are, again, rarely if ever used to hold police accountable).</p>
<p>The SIU’s decision renewed ongoing concerns about police oversight in Ontario. The SIU is lauded by government proponents as the “gold standard” of police oversight internationally. Yet SIU investigations have been undermined by obstruction and harassment from police, which are not properly dealt with, and plagued by a repeated lack of transparency regarding decision-making and real questions about the degree to which officers have actually been held accountable (Gillis 2017a). These problem have been documented in detail within this project.</p>
<p>So questionable was the SIU decision in this case that it, along with the community protests, contributed to the initiation of the provincial review of police oversight by Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch, which made recommendations around transparency and police compliance. Public concern over the case led to the unprecedented release in 2016 of the SIU director’s report into Loku’s killing. Yet that document was heavily redacted and not particularly insightful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intersections of State Violence: Police, Racism, and Mental Health</p>
<p>Toward the end of 2016 a coalition of community groups sent a letter to presiding coroner Carlisle requesting that he broaden the scope of the inquest to examine the intersecting roles of race and mental in the officer’s quick decision to view Loku as a threat and to kill him. The November 2016 submission by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Law Union of Ontario, Ryerson University’s criminology department and others notes that the inquest cannot hope to live up to its stated purpose of preventing future deaths if, in their words “Mr. Loku’s race, immigration and mental health status are kept out of the inquest process” (quoted in Gillis 2017a). Unfortunately coroner’s inquests are rather functional, examining specific circumstances of a particular death and do not analyse broader systemic issues of inequality and injustice as are in fact crucial to understanding state violence.</p>
<p>Some groups have requested standing in the inquest in order to raise significant questions about race and mental health that would otherwise be overlooked by such an inquest. Howard Morton, lawyer for the group Across Boundaries, explains that if granted status the group hopes to examine key issues of intersectionality. In particular there is a need to address why Black men who are suffering from mental health issues are so often the victims of fatal encounters with police officers (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In fact, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) leased units inside the building in which Loku was killed. The apartments provide housing for people with mental health challenges. The inquest should, at minimum, address the extent to which police officers were aware that Loku’s address was connected to the CMHA, an indication that some residents deal with mental health challenges (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In the words of Kingsley Gilliam, a spokesperson for the Black Action Defence Committee, outside the courtroom on Monday: “He did not need to die. We need a shift in paradigm, where we shift crisis intervention away from police” (quoted in Gillis 2017b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Inquest</p>
<p>The inquest, with a jury of five members, is slated to last three weeks and hear from around 20 witnesses. The inquest has no powers and will simply make recommendations to prevent similar deaths. These are typically ignored or selectively implemented, but not necessarily practiced after implementation, by police. There can be no criminal findings and no charges can result. No findings for compensation can be offered. Inquests can lead to the naming of killer cops and are some of the only, very limited, means for doing so in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>Expectations for the inquest should be tempered given its limited scope and powers. There have already been numerous inquests into police violence and the killing of civilians. All that they have really done is to highlight that the police in Canada are brutal and kill a stunningly large number of people. And they kill Black people and people dealing with mental health issues with haste.</p>
<p>The previous inquests have made recommendations around increased de-escalation training and reducing stigmatization for people dealing with mental health issues. Training has not translated into action and, really, serves largely as window dressing for police forces and means of extra pay for officers. And, of course, we can never forget that police are instituted and officers paid to kill.</p>

       **<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is investigating after an Ottawa police officer was involved in an exchange in which two people were killed and one left injured. The details of the killings have not been released publicly but it has been reported by the SIU that a 31-year-old man was killed during an exchange of gunfire with police and another man, 43 years old, was killed during the police pursuit. None of these reports have been independently confirmed. The incident is said to have taken place around 2 AM on the morning of Saturday, June 3 in Ottawa’s popular downtown Byward Market area, a tourist destination not far from the Parliament buildings. The 31-year-old victim was chased by the police officer into a parking garage before he was killed. The injured man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Mathieu Fleury, the city councillor for the market area, wasted no time in playing up the drugs and gangs panics that are often trotted out to justify police violence. In a written statement provided to CBC News, Fleury said the incident “is reflective of the drug and gang activity across our city” (quoted in 2017). This is nothing more than crass fear politics and there is so far nothing to suggest it has any relation to the present case. Neither the SIU nor the Ottawa police have claimed that the Saturday shootings are in any way drug or gang related. The claim is not new though and has been used by the Calgary police chief to justify multiple police killings of civilians in that city (even where they have nothing to do with drugs or gangs).</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned 10 officers to the investigation: three investigators and seven forensics investigators. In addition to the subject officer, two witness officers from the Ottawa police have been identified.</p>

       **<p>A 2017 Toronto police report on Taser use in 2016 claims that no one died from Tasers in 2016 despite the fact that the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines police harm to civilians, is still investigating the death of 31-year-old Rui Nabico. On November 4, 2016, Nabico went into medical distress after Toronto police fired a stun gun at him. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The young man only went into medical distress after being Tasered so the Toronto police report is clearly false. A piece of copaganda.</p>
       **<p>The Toronto police officers who killed Andrew Loku on July 5, 2015, have finally been identified as Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub. They were named as the officer’s involved on July 9, 2017, during the coroner’s  inquest into Loku’s killing when police lawyer Gary Clewley asked the men to rise from their seats to be identified by a witness. Even now, however, it was not said which of the two officers shot Loku. That identification is, after all this time, expected to come during the second week of the inquest when the officers are set to testify.</p>
<p>Video surveillance footage of events prior to the shooting of Loku in the hallway outside his apartment shows that he was not threatening his neighbors as he has been accused of. The neighbors do not appear afraid of him and some speak with him though there is no audio in the footage. Neighbor and witness Robin Hicks claimed on the stand that she was afraid <em>for</em> Loku not <em>of</em> Loku when police arrived. The footage also shows Loku holding a hammer in a manner that does not appear to be threatening (not fully by the handle).</p>
<p>Still, police shot and killed Andrew Loku within 19 seconds of encountering him and within only five minutes of the 911 call that apparently brought them. Because the state protects the state, the killer cops Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub have already been cleared by the Special Investigations Unit.</p>
       **<p>The coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Andrew Loku began in Toronto on Monday, June 5, 2017. Loku, a 45-year-old refugee from South Sudan who struggled with mental health issues after having been kidnapped and tortured there, was shot and killed by Toronto police as he stood in his apartment hallway on July 5, 2015. On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the 911 call that preceded his killing was released as part of the inquest.</p>
<p>The call reveals that police waited no more than 19 seconds after encountering Loku before shooting and killing him. He had stood in the hallway without harming anyone for at least four minutes and forty seconds before police arrived. The two officers, one a coach and the other a new recruit with only a few months on the job, are immediately heard on the tape telling Loku to drop his perceived weapon, a hammer he held at his side.  Indistinct noises, mostly yelling by police, follow over the 19 seconds. And then. Two very distinct gunshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 caller, distraught: “Oh, my god. Oh, my god.”</p>
<p>The 911 operator: “What was that?”</p>
<p>The caller: “That was gunshots. Gunshots from the police officer.”</p>
<p>A male voice then breaks through telling everyone to stay in their apartments. This is repeated by the operator.</p>
<p>Then the caller, in pained recognition: “They killed him?”</p>
<p>The operator: “Oh, my. What?”</p>
<p>Then, sadly, a child, softly: “He’s dead?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, violent force was first and foremost on the officers’ minds. There was no, even minimal, attempt to interact humanly with Andrew Loku. Never mind de-escalation, because the police were the only ones to escalate in the first place. Nineteen seconds was all they gave him.</p>
       **<p>Devon LaFleur, a young man struggling with mental health issues, was killed by Toronto police who had been informed of his mental illness and of the fact that the “weapon” he held was a broken pellet gun that did not work. His family had shared that information with Ottawa police who contacted Toronto police about the young man. Still police rained down at least 21 bullets on him striking him eight times. On June 6, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) ruled, incredibly, that despite this Toronto police were “more than justified” in killing LaFleur. <em>More than justified</em>.</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s mother, attributes the killing of her son to a failure of communication by police and inadequate, improper, or insufficient training of police in interacting with people experiencing mental health issues. LaFleur had schizophrenia and was apparently not on his medication the night police killed him.</p>
<p>According to Rena LaFleur, police disregarded the information they had, instead choosing to take a typically aggressive and confrontational approach with the young man. In her words:</p>
<p>“They created a situation in which they were confronting [him]. I can’t see how they can possibly justify that that is a viable mental health protocol. It&#8217;s shameful. I find it&#8217;s just a shame and many more people are going to die, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur reveals that she had spoken with police about her son’s situation and there was a plan to have plainclothes Toronto officers attend the home of a friend with whom Devon LaFleur was meeting. She suggests: “They had a lot of time. They had what seemed to be a good plan in place and they changed it at the last minute” (quoted in 2017). She does not know why.</p>
<p>What did happen is that four uniformed police officers arrived at the friend’s house in marked cruisers. Officers yelled at the distressed man throughout the encounter and drew their guns on him. According to the SIU one officer fired 12 to 13 shots, the second fired eight to nine shots, while the third fired one bullet.</p>
<p>Sascha LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s sister suggests: “So how do you say [we’ll shoot] to somebody who’s in psychosis, that believes that the angels will protect him from the bullets. You’re provoking him. There needs to be other methods of de-escalation, not lethal force, because you can’t come back from that” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>As Rena LaFleur puts it, painfully directly: “He didn’t have to die” (quoted in 2017).</p>

       **<p>Toronto area police have killed several people in the past few years for holding or being near BB guns. Over the past year alone, two Ontario coroner’s inquests and one SIU investigation have involved people killed by police under such circumstances.</p>
<p>In November of 2013, Ian Pryce was killed by Toronto police while apparently holding what turned out to be a pellet gun. Only months later, John Caleb Ross of Aurora was killed by a York Regional police officer while apparently carrying a pellet gun. On March 13, 2016, Alex Wettlaufer was shot three times and killed by Toronto police. He was said to have held a pellet gun but by the SIU’s own account had repeatedly set down during a lengthy standoff.</p>

       **<p>A police chase in Edmonton has left one man dead and a woman in hospital with life-threatening injuries.  after a stolen truck involved in a police chase collided head-on with a car Monday evening. The pursuit started at around 8 PM on the evening of Monday, July 3, 2017 near 170<sup>th</sup> Street and 87<sup>th</sup> Avenue. Police apparently pursued the vehicle, a truck, west out of the city in the Winterburn Road area of the city. The truck is said to have collided head-on with a car on the exit ramp from Anthony Henday Drive southbound leading to Whitemud Drive westbound. The man driving the car died at the scene. A female passenger in the car was taken to hospital and suffers life-threatening injuries. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating.</p>

       **<p>Police in Saskatchewan investigate police. There is no independent civilian oversight body in the province despite ongoing calls from community advocates.</p>
<p>On July 5, 2017, officers of the Blaine Lake Saskatchewan RCMP allegedly responded to a call about a distraught man with a firearm in a rural area. Two officers encountered a man who they say discharged the weapon, resulting in a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man was taken to hospital in Saskatoon and pronounced dead there. The Saskatchewan RCMP have requested an investigation into the death, which will be conducted by the Saskatoon Police Service.</p>

       **<p>A police chase in Pointe-Calumet, west of Île Bizard, Quebec, July 30, 2017, has left one pedestrian, a 66-year-old man, dead. Eight investigators of the province’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the body that examines police harm to civilians in Quebec, are looking into the case. Police supposedly began pursuit of the car after it allegedly made “strange maneuvers.” The car later crashed into a Hydro-Quebec pole. The three occupants were arrested and taken to hospital with injuries.</p>

       **<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is investigating the police involved death of a 48-year-old man in Sudbury in the early morning of Monday, September 4, 2017. According to the SIU, Sudbury police responded to a call shortly after midnight and set up a perimeter around a residence. Police officers and paramedics entered the home around two and a half hours later and a 48-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. No other details have been provided publicly, including the reason for the initial call, nor information about  what transpired after police entered the house. The SIU has assigned three SIU investigators and two forensic investigators to examine this case. The victim’s name has not been released.</p>

       **<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which investigates police harm to civilians in Ontario, is examining the death of a 34-year-old man at a residence in Windsor on Friday, September 15, 2017.  According to the SIU, police were assisting an investigation by police in nearby Amherstburg, Ontario. They say police set up a perimeter around the Windsor home, later entering to find the man dead in the garage.</p>
       **<p>Is it possible that police harassment or intimidation could lead someone to kill themselves? Is it possible that police might communicate to a vulnerable suspect in such a way that the person might then take their own life? Could fear of a specific officer lead someone to kill themselves if that officer called to tell them of an impending arrest or threaten them? These are only some of the questions that needed to be raised after a 43-year-old Smith Falls, Ontario, man killed himself on June 3, 2017, after a Rideau Lakes OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) officer called to tell him that he was facing charges and told him he should turn himself in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the head of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario, Tony Loparco, decided to terminate the investigation into the man’s death. That investigation had three SIU and two forensics investigators starting work. In an SIU media release, Loparco is quoted as saying:</p>
<p>“A post-mortem examination confirmed that the man died as a result of complications from a gunshot to the chest. When the man shot himself, no police officer was present. As such, there being no evidence that any police officer was responsible for the man&#8217;s death, this investigation has been terminated.”</p>
<p>This conclusion might be satisfying for police, their promoters, and copagandists everywhere but it does not address the key, pressing questions. Did the officer’s communication with the man contribute to his shooting himself? No officer needed to be present if intimidation, harassment, or threats led the man to despair. By terminating the investigation Loparco has ensured that these questions will not be properly pursued to real answers. Loparco has appeared quite friendly to police and drawn criticism from families of victims of police violence during his tenure.</p>

       **<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, announced on October 2, 2017, that it is investigating an in-custody death in Quesnel, BC. The victim, identified as a woman, reportedly died only hours after being arrested by RCMP.</p>
<p>According to the IIO, RCMP officers claim they were called on reports of an assault early Sunday morning. Upon arrival they found a female victim who they decided to arrest for allegedly breaching a court-imposed condition. The victim was arrested and taken to the local RCMP detachment where police claim she was examined by paramedics before being taken to hospital. The woman died in custody Monday morning.</p>
<p>Police accounts have not been independently verified. No further details have been publicly released. Neither has it been explained why the victim of an assault was not treated as such and taken directly to hospital rather than arrested for an administrative offense and taken to the detachment. People detained over so-called administrative offenses make up a relatively large proportion of people incarcerated in British Columbia.</p>

       ***<p>The Independent Investigations Unit (IIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians, is investigating the death of a 23-year-old pedestrian struck and killed by a vehicle Tuesday around 8 PM at the corner of Main Street and Sutherland Avenue. The investigation has led to the arrest of a Winnipeg police officer. The young victim was taken to hospital in critical condition and later died as a result of the injuries caused by the officer.</p>
       <p>On Friday, October 13, 2017, Winnipeg police Chief Danny Smyth told the city’s civilian police board that additional charges could be coming against Constable Justin Holz  for allegedly driving while impaired and fleeing the scene after hitting and killing pedestrian Cody Severight on October 10, 2017.  Smyth told the board that the results of a breathalyzer have not yet been analyzed and could bring about the further criminal charge of driving with a blood alcohol concentration over .08, which is 80 milligrams of alcohol for every 100 milliliters of blood. Constable Holz has been charged with impaired driving causing death and failure to remain at the scene.</p>
<p>Smyth also told the police board that further disciplinary action could be taken against Constable Holz once the investigation is complete. This could come even before the case goes to court. Holz is presently on administrative leave with pay but Smyth acknowledged that future disciplinary action could include dismissal of the officer.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a Winnipeg police officer has hit and killed someone while driving after an evening of drinking. In 2005 officer Derek Harvey-Zenk killed Crystal Taman after driving home from an all night drinking party with other officers. Several charges were initially brought against Harvey-Zenk, including impaired driving causing death, but all except dangerous driving causing death were stayed in a highly controversial plea bargain. Harvey-Zenk was eventually sentenced to two years less a day to be served at home.</p>
<p>Upon hearing about Constable Holz killing Cody Severight while driving after drinking, Robert Taman, Crystal Taman’s husband, expressed sadness and dismay. Taman, who became an advocate for police reform after the killing of his wife, offered a stark assessment of prospects for change among police:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But it never changes. So if it doesn’t change [that means] they don’t find it important enough to change, so it’s going to continue until the organization, the association, somebody steps up and says, ‘That’s enough.’” (quoted in CBC News 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no one should hold their breath awaiting additional charges or further disciplinary actions from police. Despite what the chief says.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit, which examines all cases of harm to civilians serious incidents involving police officers in Manitoba, is investigating the killing. Holz has been released from custody on a promise to appear in court on November 22, 2017.</p>

       <p>Winnipeg police Constable Justin Holz has been charged with impaired driving causing death and failure to remain at the scene after striking and killing pedestrian Cody Severight (23) with his vehicle on the evening of Tuesday, October 10, 2017. According to the Independent Investigations Unit, which is examining the killing, the 34-year-old Holz was located more than seven kilometers away fro the crash scene. Holz is an eight-year member of the Winnipeg police and was assigned as a criminal investigator. He has been placed on administrative leave but is still being paid. Winnipeg police traffic collision investigators assisted the IIU with a breathalyzer but it has not been revealed publicly whether Holz had a blood test to determine alcohol levels.</p>
<p>Holz was apparently working the day shift and would have gotten off work around 4:30 PM. He then allegedly went drinking until the crash at around 8:00 PM. Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth tried to suggest it is not unusual for someone to go for drinks after work. The issue here through is that the cop then apparently decide to get in his vehicle and race home.</p>
<p>Witness Donnie Fizell has reported seeing a car speeding down the street before striking Severight. In his words: “He must have flew 15 feet in the air and his head hit the curb. [Constable Holz] must have been doing 80 [km/h] when he hit that poor boy” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Cody Severight is from the Waywayseecappo First Nation, about 280 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. He had recently started classes at the Winnipeg Adult Education Centre to obtain his Grade 12. He and his partner were expecting a baby soon (Bernhardt 2017). His grandmother Gloria Lebold describes him: “He was a sweet little guy, always joking around, just being a little fun person” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Severight’s aunt, Nancy Gabriel, spoke honestly about the situation and noted the anti-Indigenous racism that has marked Winnipeg policing. In her view, police are supposed to be protecting people, “not killing people” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017). She continued: “As soon as he struck him he should have stopped straight away, not just keep on driving. You know how that looks, that looks like, ‘Oh that’s just another native.’ He was a good guy” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Cody Severight will be buried next to his mother.</p>
<p>This is the third incident of police harm to civilians that the IIU has had to investigate this week alone in Winnipeg.</p>

       *<p>Killer Winnipeg cop Justin Holz, 36, pleaded guilty on October 30, 2019, to dangerous driving causing death for the collision that killed 23-year-old Cody Severight in 2017. Holz hit Severight and left the young Indigenous man to die in the road. A Manitoba provincial court judge agreed to a joint recommendation by lawyers and sentenced Holz to 30 months in prison. A rare case of a killer cop being charged, and an even more rare outcome that would see a killer cop do time in prison.</p>
<p>The court heard that Holz met other police officers for drinks at a bar starting before 5 PM on the evening of October 10, 2017. He drove off from a nearby car park around three hours later. Investigators calculated Holz was driving at up to 92 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. He hit Severight, who was crossing the street with another person, while going at least 76 km/h. According to the Court, Severight was launched across the road, his skull fractured and his neck broken in the collision.</p>
<p>Despite clearly striking someone, Holz did not stop or attempt to help the victim. Instead he continued to drive on, even increasing his speed up to 129 km/h. Almost 12 minutes after striking Severight, Holz parked and called police, saying he had hit someone. A breathalyzer test was done on Holz more than an hour after he struck Severight. The conduct of two other officers in delaying the breathalyzer was questioned but no disciplinary actions taken against them.</p>
<p>Severight was later taken to hospital but died of his injuries.</p>
<p>Holz had originally faced other offences, including impaired driving. Those charges were following the guilty plea.</p>
       *<p>Killer Winnipeg cop Justin Holz is facing three additional charges of dangerous driving causing death, dangerous driving, and driving with a blood-alcohol level over .08 per cent causing death for the hit and run killing of 23-year-old Cody Severight, an Indigenous man from the Waywayseecappo First Nation, about 280 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. Holz was initially charged with impaired driving causing death and failing to remain at the scene of an accident. The new charges were announced on November 28, 2017. Holz is on administrative leave with pay.</p>
<p>Holz (34) had been drinking after his shift before getting in his vehicle and striking Severight while the young man crossed Main Street near Sutherland Avenue around 8 PM on October 10, 2017. The killer cop then left the scene of the killing.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba has continued its investigation since the killing. At the time of the initial charges results of a breathalyzer test had not been returned. Two other police officers who had been assigned to investigate the hit and run have also been placed on paid administrative leave and could face charges for their actions. The maximum sentence for a conviction for dangerous driving causing death is presently 14 years, but legislation proposed earlier this year would increase that to life.</p>
<p>Cody Severight’s grandmother, Gloria Lebold, said that she is glad that the killer cop is facing more charges. In her words: “I’m glad he’s got all of these charges. I’m glad he’s going to have to deal with them” (quoted in CBC News 2017). And this is indeed a rare event. Probably one that would not have occurred had Holz been on duty at the time since cops who kill while o duty are almost never charged, even under obviously dubious circumstances like this. Continued Lebold: “I think he should go to jail. He did a terrible thing. He took an innocent life, only 23 years old. We loved our little grandson” (quoted in CBC News 2017). The family has called for an apology from the cop who killed their loved one.</p>
<p>Denise Elias, Mothers Against Drunk Driving Winnipeg chapter president, expressed disappointment with officer Holz. In her words: “The first feeling that I had was sadness. It is very disappointing, very hurtful”,  adding her disappointment was greater considering Holz was someone who has sworn “to uphold the law, to abide by the law” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Killer cop Justin Holz had his first court appearance scheduled for Wednesday, November 22, but a representative from his lawyer’s firm appeared on his behalf. Holz is currently out on bail.</p>
<p>Severight had just moved to a new apartment and was planning on going back to school when Holz cut his dreams short. Said Gloria Lebold: “We loved our Cody. This little guy was just starting his life” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       *<p>Questions are being raised publicly about egregious delay in police officers administering a breathalyzer test to their colleague who was involved in a fatal hit-and-run in Winnipeg. Constable Justin Holz (34) was arrested away from the scene a short tome after striking 23-year-old Indigenous man Cody Severight of Waywayseecappo First Nation on October 10, 2017.</p>
<p>Len Eastoe, a former cop who now runs Traffic Ticket Experts to help people fight fines, cannot understand why it took three to four hours to administer the test to Constable Holz. Said Eastoe: “It is a rather strange period of time” (quoted in CBC 2017). Eastoe notes that there can be a passage of time in administering the breath test, in this case the gap between when the crash happened and when Holz was tested is much too wide. He suggests that the test is usually done within two hours. In his view: “There has to be some sort of a reason for that, and then you’ve really got questions as to whether that test is going to be admissible or not” (quoted in CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Of course, some would offer the rather obvious answer that they are doing what cops routinely do in protecting their colleagues who kill. And in this case, as Eastoe suggests, it could rule the test inadmissible in any court proceedings against the officer, thus shielding him from conviction.</p>
<p>Even more, two police officers who had been assigned to investigate Holz have been placed on paid administrative leave and could face charges, for as yet unspecified activities. Winnipeg police Chief Danny Smyth has only said that the officers did not administer the breathalyzer test and were not at the scene of the collision.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), Manitoba’s police oversight body, said on Friday, October 20, that it had been notified of “irregular and improper conduct of two officers” and is assessing whether charges should be laid. It ahs been reported that one of the officers in question was at The Pint, the bar at which officer Holz was drinking before getting in his car and killing Cody Severight. Did they watch as their colleague got into his car to drive off after an evening of drinking?</p>
<p>Constable Holz has been charged with impaired driving causing death and fleeing the scene of an accident.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But it never changes. So if it doesn’t change [that means] they don’t find it important enough to change, so it’s going to continue until the organization, the association, somebody steps up and says, ‘That’s enough.’” (quoted in CBC News 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no one should hold their breath awaiting additional charges or further disciplinary actions from police. Despite what the chief says.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit, which examines all cases of harm to civilians serious incidents involving police officers in Manitoba, is investigating the killing. Holz has been released from custody on a promise to appear in court on November 22, 2017.</p>

       *<p>Winnipeg police Constable Justin Holz has been charged with impaired driving causing death and failure to remain at the scene after striking and killing pedestrian Cody Severight (23) with his vehicle on the evening of Tuesday, October 10, 2017. According to the Independent Investigations Unit, which is examining the killing, the 34-year-old Holz was located more than seven kilometers away fro the crash scene. Holz is an eight-year member of the Winnipeg police and was assigned as a criminal investigator. He has been placed on administrative leave but is still being paid. Winnipeg police traffic collision investigators assisted the IIU with a breathalyzer but it has not been revealed publicly whether Holz had a blood test to determine alcohol levels.</p>
<p>Holz was apparently working the day shift and would have gotten off work around 4:30 PM. He then allegedly went drinking until the crash at around 8:00 PM. Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth tried to suggest it is not unusual for someone to go for drinks after work. The issue here through is that the cop then apparently decide to get in his vehicle and race home.</p>
<p>Witness Donnie Fizell has reported seeing a car speeding down the street before striking Severight. In his words: “He must have flew 15 feet in the air and his head hit the curb. [Constable Holz] must have been doing 80 [km/h] when he hit that poor boy” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Cody Severight is from the Waywayseecappo First Nation, about 280 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. He had recently started classes at the Winnipeg Adult Education Centre to obtain his Grade 12. He and his partner were expecting a baby soon (Bernhardt 2017). His grandmother Gloria Lebold describes him: “He was a sweet little guy, always joking around, just being a little fun person” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Severight’s aunt, Nancy Gabriel, spoke honestly about the situation and noted the anti-Indigenous racism that has marked Winnipeg policing. In her view, police are supposed to be protecting people, “not killing people” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017). She continued: “As soon as he struck him he should have stopped straight away, not just keep on driving. You know how that looks, that looks like, ‘Oh that’s just another native.’ He was a good guy” (quoted in Bernhardt 2017).</p>
<p>Cody Severight will be buried next to his mother.</p>
<p>This is the third incident of police harm to civilians that the IIU has had to investigate this week alone in Winnipeg.</p>

       **<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating the death of a 44-year-old man during an arrest outside a home in Brampton on October 31, 2017.</p>
<p>According to the SIU, a 911 call was made to Peel Region police at around 8:45 AM. The SIU further suggests that police officers arrived at a residence near Bovaird Drive and McLaughlin Road sometime later. There police reportedly “interacted with a man” who was then taken to hospital where he later died. The SIU statement did not provide any specific detail regarding what the “interaction” entailed, any details of the man’s injuries, or why the 911 call was made in the first place.</p>
<p>The SIU has said in a statement that two officers are under investigation. Details about the victim’s identity have not been released publicly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
       **<p>Details are still emerging about a police involved shooting at the Northumberland Hills Hospital emergency room during which two people were left dead, at least one whom was killed by police. The incident unfolded right before midnight, Friday, October 27, 2017, at the hospital in Cobourg, Ontario, a small town about 115 Kilometers east of Toronto. The two victims are a husband and wife in their 70s. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating.</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Jason Gennaro has publicly stated that police in Cobourg were initially called to the hospital emergency room on reports of the sound of gunshots at about 11 PM. The SIU reports that police claim they encountered the 70-year-old man and two officers fired their weapons striking the man and killing him. He was pronounced dead on the scene. The SIU reports that officers then found a 76-year-old woman who was dead, apparently of some type of head wound.</p>
<p>The SIU has only confirmed that the couple were admitted to hospital. “for unknown ailments” and that at some point in the evening they had been next to each other on gurney’s in a triage area of the emergency room. Other important details have not been released publicly or confirmed.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation that the woman had been shot, but Gennaro would not confirm that. It has also not been confirmed at this point that the man had any type of weapon.</p>
<p>One witness claims hearing at least five or six shots after police arrived. Other witnesses have reported hearing multiple shots in a manner that suggested to them the use of an assault weapon.</p>
<p>Northumberland Hills Hospital has only confirmed in a statement that there was a “serious incident” in its emergency department that involved a weapon. There are no details on whether this refers to the police weapons or another weapon. The SIU has not confirmed that the man had a weapon, but questions have been asked of the hospital how a patient with a gun could be admitted.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned six investigators and two forensic investigators to investigate this shooting by police.</p>
       **<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano, a York police officer, will be headed to trial for a third time on charges of dangerous driving causing death for the killing of 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado in February 2014. Romano (45) was on duty and behind the wheel of an undercover police pickup truck when he struck Natasha Abogado as she attempted to cross St. Clair Avenue East around 8 PM.</p>
<p>Romano was traveling at a speed of least 109 kilometers per hour in a 60-km/hr zone. He was reportedly trying to catch up to other members of his surveillance team, not I active pursuit of anyone.</p>
<p>Romano was tried in May 2016, but a jury was did not come to a unanimous verdict after a few days of deliberating, resulting in a mistrial. Romano was tried again in September 2016 and a jury acquitted him of dangerous driving causing death. Following that decision, the Crown prosecutor filed an appeal, citing issues with the way in which the judge directed the jury to come to its verdict (Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>On September 28, 2017, a panel of three court of appeal judges agreed with the Crown and ordered a new trial. They found that the trial judge, Justice Brian O’Marra, did wrongly explain the dangerous driving law to the jury. Specifically, the judge incorrectly instructed the jurors not only to focus on how Romano’s actions as a driver caused Abogado’s death, but also how the victim Abogado herself might have been at fault (Beattie 2017). Another case of victim blaming to excuse or justify a police killing of a civilian.</p>
<p>Justice David Paciocco said in his decision: “Most significantly, the trial judge made irrelevant and adverse comments about Ms. Abogado’s conduct” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>Incredibly, according to Paciocco, O’Marra instructed the jury to consider that Abogado was jaywalking and described that as an “inherently risky activity” (despite the fact that people do it all the time without harm) and that “pedestrians must be aware, when they jaywalk, that drivers are not always paying attention, not always concentrating on what is going on ahead of them” (quoted in Beattie 2017). Even more O’Marra took a page out of the “what was she wearing” playbook for dismissing women victims of crime, and argued that Abogado’s clothing was dark and had “poor visibility” at the time of the collision (Beattie 2017). This was simply a replay, and reinforcement, of the Romano legal team’s defense ploy to get their client off.</p>
<p>The appeals decision noted that these statements turned the jury’s attention away from the central issue of whether or not Romano’s driving was itself, in fact, dangerous (Beattie 2017). By then the damage had been done to the Crown’s case. Concluded Paciocco: “The errors in the charge … are sufficiently serious that the jury was not in a position to evaluate properly the dangerousness of the operation of the motor vehicle, leading to a miscarriage of justice” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>At the second trial, Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter pointed out that Romano operated his vehicle at such a high rate of speed that it became impossible for him to adjust his driving in the event that something unexpected happened (Beattie 2017). Even more, his speeding was entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable according to the Crown. The surveillance operation that Romano was part of was only focused on intelligence-gathering and, as such, was neither dangerous nor urgent (Beattie 2017). It should never have resulted in the death of an innocent young woman.</p>
<p>York Regional police have confirmed that Detective-Constable Remo Romano is still an active officer on the force.</p>

       <p>Quebec’s Independent Investigations Bureau (BEI), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the in custody death of David Tshiteya Kalubi, a 23-year-old Black youth. Kalubi, who was arrested by Montreal police in his own neighborhood of Hochelaga, was declared dead less that 12 hours after his arrest.</p>
<p>Little information has been released publicly. Police say Kalubi was stopped by officers in Hochelaga and arrested on an outstanding warrant after police ran a background check. The BEI has not stated publicly what the outstanding warrant was for, only that it involved a municipal offense.</p>
<p>Community activists in the city, which has seen many cases of lethal police violence against civilians, and disproportionately against Black people, are raising concerns about Kalubi’s death and the actions of police. Racial profiling and so-called carding, where people are stopped by police and subjected to interrogation and/or background checks, have been strongly condemned by community members in cities across Canada. Carding goes hand in hand with profiling as Black people are disproportionately stopped for carding checks in Canadian contexts. Kalubi is of Congolese background.</p>
<p>Montreal police reportedly took Kalubi to the station, where he spent the night before being transferred to the municipal courthouse in Old Montreal to appear before a judge, according to the BEI. The transfer took place at 7:35 AM. Only a little more than an hour later, at 8:55 AM, a guard noticed that Kalubi was on the floor and appeared to be unconscious. He was then taken to the hospital and declared dead at 9:55 AM. Community members are raising concerns that Kalubi was subjected to differential, discriminatory, treatment because of histories of police racism in Montreal. The family, for its part has not raised the issues of racial profiling. According to the family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire: “For the moment, there’s not enough information to know if it’s a case of racial profiling, but with a young black man arrested it can look like racial profiling” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Dan Philip, the executive director of the Black Coalition of Quebec has said publicly that it took police seven hours to notify his mother and family of Kalubi’s death. Even then, police took the opportunity to  first interrogated the family about Kalubi, before telling them he was dead, according to Philip. Said Philip, in an interview with CBC News: “They felt it was a travesty. They felt there was no compassion. They felt that there was no concern about either the death of the young man or the family themselves who have to mourn the situation” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Community advocates have little confidence that the BEI will provide satisfactory answers to the family’s many questions. Critics have long pointed out that the BEI includes several former police officers among its active members.  As Philips suggests: “It’s the police investigating the police. They have no interest in finding out why did he died and what negligence caused his death” (quoted in MacArthur 2017). It has also been pointed out repeatedly that the BEI lacks any meaningful diversity. It is expected that their report will not be released for another year yet.</p>

       ***<p>Killer Quebec cop Patrick Ouellet, a member of the provincial force the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), will not have the charge dropped for killing  five-year-old Nicholas Thorne-Belance in 2014, a Quebec judge has decided. Ouellet had filed a motion seeking to have the charge of dangerous driving causing death dropped and has alleged interference in the case by Quebec Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée.</p>
<p>Ouellet was involved in a police surveillance operation in which he was tailing the director of the Quebec Liberal Party in an unmarked car on February 13, 2014. During this operation officer Ouellet crashed into a car in which Thorne-Belance was a passenger in Longueuil, south of Montreal. Oullet’s care was traveling at a speed in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in a 50 km/hr zone. The young Thorne-Belance died in a hospital a few days after the crash.</p>
<p>The Crown prosecutor had initially decided not to lay charges, the usual result in cases of police killing civilians, even children, in Canada. A single charge was filed against Ouellet in 2015 after Vallée ordered an independent review of the case amid strong public pressure. Quebec Court Judge Denys Noel ruled on November 21, 2017, that there was no interference on Vallée’s part. Concluded Judge Noel: “One cannot infer from the evidence that the minister ordered the director (to file the charge). There is no evidence of abuse of procedure that would allow for the proceedings to be dropped.” Killer cop  Patrick Ouellet’s trial is scheduled to begin in June, 2018.</p>
       *<p>Quebec’s Independent Investigations Bureau (BEI), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the in custody death of David Tshiteya Kalubi, a 23-year-old Black youth. Kalubi, who was arrested by Montreal police in his own neighborhood of Hochelaga, was declared dead less that 12 hours after his arrest.</p>
<p>Little information has been released publicly. Police say Kalubi was stopped by officers in Hochelaga and arrested on an outstanding warrant after police ran a background check. The BEI has not stated publicly what the outstanding warrant was for, only that it involved a municipal offense.</p>
<p>Community activists in the city, which has seen many cases of lethal police violence against civilians, and disproportionately against Black people, are raising concerns about Kalubi’s death and the actions of police. Racial profiling and so-called carding, where people are stopped by police and subjected to interrogation and/or background checks, have been strongly condemned by community members in cities across Canada. Carding goes hand in hand with profiling as Black people are disproportionately stopped for carding checks in Canadian contexts. Kalubi is of Congolese background.</p>
<p>Montreal police reportedly took Kalubi to the station, where he spent the night before being transferred to the municipal courthouse in Old Montreal to appear before a judge, according to the BEI. The transfer took place at 7:35 AM. Only a little more than an hour later, at 8:55 AM, a guard noticed that Kalubi was on the floor and appeared to be unconscious. He was then taken to the hospital and declared dead at 9:55 AM. Community members are raising concerns that Kalubi was subjected to differential, discriminatory, treatment because of histories of police racism in Montreal. The family, for its part has not raised the issues of racial profiling. According to the family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire: “For the moment, there’s not enough information to know if it’s a case of racial profiling, but with a young black man arrested it can look like racial profiling” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>

       **<p>Killer Toronto cop James Forcillo is going to prison after his bail was revoked it was announced on November 30, 2017. Forcillo shot and killed 18-year-old Sammy Yatim on July 27, 2013, shooting the teenager multiple times, including after he had fallen to the ground from a fatal shot, even though Yatim was alone on an empty streetcar and posed no immediate threat to the public or to police. The killing was captured on video. Constable Forcillo was convicted in 2016 of attempted murder in the killing, because he shot Yatim after he had fallen to the ground of wounds already inflicted by the officer. He was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>
<p>Forcillo had been out on bail pending the appeal of his conviction. He was arrested earlier in November 2017 for allegedly failing to comply with the bail conditions by failing to live with his surety or to inform authorities of a change of address, according to police. Forcillo has been in custody for two weeks since his arrest.</p>
<p>Following his arrest, the Attorney General of Ontario applied to have Forcillo’s bail revoked. A judge granted that request this week. Forcillo will remain in police custody while a charge of breaching bail is dealt with in court. That court date is set for December 15, 2017. He will then be transferred to federal prison to begin serving his prison sentence.</p>
       **<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating the death of a 57-year-old man in custody of Toronto police on the evening of Sunday, November 26, 2017. According to the SIU, the man, who has not yet been named publicly, was sitting handcuffed in an apartment building security office when Toronto police officers arrived in response to a disturbance call. The SIU reports that after the officers searched the man he was returned to a sitting position. A short time later, the man fell over and his vital signs were absent. He was pronounced dead in hospital early on the morning of Monday, November 27. No other details have been released publicly, including information regarding why the man was arrested in the first place, or what the so-called disturbance involved.</p>
       **<p>No explanation has been given for why charges of criminal negligence causing death have been dropped against Constable Mark McKillop of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) in the death of Debra Chrisjohn (39) of Oneida Nation of the Thames.</p>
<p>In a public statement Chrisjohn’s family said this about the dropping of charges: “The decision by the Crown… is hard for the family to understand. We hope that everyone who played a role will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province,  had charged two police officers with the death of Chrisjohn—Constable Nicholas Doering of the London Police Service (LPS) and OPP Constable McKillop. McKillop and Doering faced one charge each of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life. Doering will still face those charges.</p>
<p>London Police Service officers responded to calls made to 911 during the late afternoon of September 7, 2016. Chrisjohn was arrested by LPS and transferred into the custody of Ontario Provincial Police with the Elgin County detachment.  At around 7:52 PM, Emergency Medical Services transported Chrisjohn to St. Thomas Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 8:43 PM.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Kasper, a lawyer at Aboriginal Legal Services and counsel for the family, noted that the family has still not been provided with basic details of the death of their loved one. Kasper explained in the public statement:</p>
<p>“Without knowing the specific details surrounding the death of Debra, it is difficult for the family to assess the decision by the office of the Crown attorney. However, we know that as this active prosecution moves towards preliminary inquiry or trial, more details will emerge. In the meantime, I certainly expect that the Ontario Provincial Police will be thoroughly reviewing the actions of Const. McKillop to determine if there were breaches of the Police Services Act.”</p>

       **<p>Very few details have been released publicly following the death of a man during an alleged standoff with officers of the Edmonton Police Service. Police engaged the man, allegedly armed, at a south Edmonton hotel beginning on the afternoon of Saturday, December 23, 2017. The encounter carried over into early Sunday morning, December, 24,  and ended with thee man’s death.</p>
<p>Edmonton police report responding to a weapons complaint, not specified publicly, at the Royal Lodge Motel on Gateway Boulevard and 38 Avenue at about 2:20 PM, after an unnamed man was allegedly shot and taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
<p>Police began negotiating with another man, said to be the shooter, who was contained and alone in a hotel suite. The standoff ended at around 2:00 AM on December 24, with the death of the shooting suspect from undisclosed causes.</p>
<p>Police report that the Alberta Director of Law Enforcement has instructed them to investigate the incident because it involves an in-custody death. There is no suggestion that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the institution that is supposed to investigate cases of police harm to civilians is or will be investigating this case. It has not been said publicly why police would be investigating police in this case.</p>
<p>None of the police claims have been independently confirmed publicly.</p>

The SIU reports that Toronto police arrested the man on the evening of Dec. 6, 2017, and put him in a cell at their division. According to the SIU, the man was found unresponsive in his cell four hours later and was taken to hospital. He was returned to police custody the following day.</p>
<p>In announcing the end of the investigation on January 30, 2018, the SIU said only that the man was not seriously injured, so the incident did not fall under the agency’s purview. This is a curious statement to say the least. No details have been released about the nature of the injuries so the public has no way of gauging their seriousness. In addition, something happened to the man related to his death in custody and that requires some explanation. Actions like this can only contribute to public questions about the role of the SIU and its closeness to police institutions in Ontario.</p>
       **<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating after a52-year-old man died of gunshot wounds during an interaction with officers of the Ontario Provincial Police in the village of Douglas. The SIU reports that police were called to a home in the village near Renfrew around 3 PM by someone concerned about a family member. At some point during the police encounter the man suffered a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
       **<p>After five years, a date has finally been set for the inquest into the death in police custody of 37-year-old Ina Matawapit, at the Weagamow Lake Nursing Station in North Caribou Lake First Nation, in northern Ontario. Matawapit died on June 7, 2012 after a transfer from a police vehicle while in custody. Matawapit’s case was one of several that have been egregiously delayed due to widespread problems with Indigenous representation on jury rolls. This ongoing, entrenched problem has characterized criminal justice systems and inquests in the Canadian state context. At least 20 cases in Ontario have been delayed by province’s jury roll problems.</p>
<p>The inquest into Matawapit’s death is mandatory under the Coroners Act because she was in custody at the time. The inquest will examine the circumstances surrounding her death by hearing from about 10 witnesses over the scheduled six days of proceedings. Dr. Michael Wilson will be presiding coroner during the inquest which is scheduled to begin at 9:30 AM on February 12, 2018 at the Days Inn in Sioux Lookout, Ontario.</p>

According to the SIU, the woman’s body was discovered at around 5:30 AM on the morning of Saturday, January 13, 2018.</p>
<p>Provincial police had had an earlier encounter with the woman when they came across what they described as a suspicious vehicle parked near Tichborne. The SIU report that the woman was found alive outside the vehicle, while the driver had allegedly fled on foot. According to the SIU, police took the woman back to her home and left. Four hours later emergency responders were called to the home where the woman was found dead. No other details have been provided publicly.

<p>Tichborne, Ontario, is approximately 130 kilometers southwest of Ottawa.</p>
       **<p>On February 12, 2014, York Regional Detective Remo Romano struck and killed 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha “Carla” Abogado while driving at speeds of 115 km/h in a 60 km/h zone on a busy Toronto street. January 17, 2018, found Romano on trial for the third time for the killing.</p>
<p>His first trial in May 2016 ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. He was acquitted in a second trial later that year but the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a retrial based on flaw’s in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. Romano is pleading not guilty. At the outset of the current trial, Superior Court Justice Todd Ducharme told the jury not to research the case, including what happened in the previous proceedings.</p>
<p>Detective Romano struck Abogado while she was crossing mid-block to her family’s home on the south side of St. Clair Avenue East, on her way home from a part-time job. Romano was speeding eastward on St. Clair Ave. E., trying to catch up with other police surveillance members of Project Litterbox, a YRP surveillance investigation into a series of non-violent commercial break-ins where around $500,000 in cosmetics and perfumes had been stolen. He was driving an unmarked truck with no sirens or flashing lights. Romano was trying to catch up to the other officers because he had been at the station retrieving another officer’s firearm that had been forgotten in a desk drawer.</p>
<p>According to the opening statement by Crown attorney Rebecca Schwartz, Romano was driving 115 km/hr in a 60 km/hr zone near a seniors’ health centre. Detective William Newton, who travelled in a police vehicle behind Romano, stated that no arrests were imminent as they sped along the busy avenue. He said that Romano was simply “trying to catch up to the action” (Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>Witness Dorota Taylor saw two police vehicles speed past her. In her testimony: “I thought they were racing because of how close they were to each other and the speed that they were going” (quoted in Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>The jury was told that a senior collision reconstructionist from the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, will testify that if Romano had  been doing even 80 km/hr that night (instead of nearly twice the legal limit) he would have been able to avoid hitting Abogado.</p>
<p>We need to remember that killer cop Romano was speeding at twice the legal limit with no lights or sirens to catch up with surveillance team members who were working on a case protecting wealth for private companies, not responding to any immediate threat (and certainly no violent one) to the public. He simply wanted to be part of “the action.” And he killed Natasha Abogado to do so.</p>

       **<p>On January 11, 2018, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, released the decision of its investigation into the fatal police shooting of a 45-year-old Nipigon man by a Ontario Provincial Police officer in November of 2016. The SIU has concluded that no charges be laid. This is the too typical outcome of SIU investigations.</p>
<p>According to the SIU report, police were called to a Nipigon residence at around 6:59 PM on November 26, 2016. They report that a woman wanted a man removed from her home as he had allegedly been drinking and was being verbally aggressive with neighbors.</p>
<p>Two OPP officers attended the residence and met the woman on the street. The SIU reports that police claim that when they arrived on the front lawn of the Nipigon home, the 45-year-old man allegedly came out of the house holding a kitchen knife in his right hand down by his side (not in a threatening manner). An OPP officer took the decision to deploy a taser on the man.</p>
<p>Once the man was tasered, officers allege he “winced in pain and stepped back into the house” before stepping outside again. This time it is claimed that the man held the knife pointed forward but parallel to the ground. An OPP officer then shot and killed the man.</p>
<p>According to the SIU, officers called Emergency Medical Services at about 7:17 PM. EMS officials recorded that the victim had no heart beat or heart activity during his transport to the hospital. He was pronounced dead soon after. The SIU report listed the cause of death as a single gunshot wound to the abdomen.</p>

Couverette was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. Four investigators and two forensic investigators have been assigned to the case.</p>
       **<p>The family of Gordon Couvrette (43), who was tased and killed by North Bay police, disputes the police account of their activities. They also say they warned police that Couvrette had a heart condition and that tasing him could be fatal. This according to a report by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) which is investigating the killing. It is reported that Couvrette died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Police claim they were called to the scene of a domestic incident early on the morning of February 22, 2018. A friend close to the Couvrette family, Emma Higgins, disputes that account of the situation. In her words, as reported by the SIU:</p>
<p>“He [Couvrette] woke up from sleep delirious from his bipolar medication and thought someone broke in so he started yelling trying to scare the ‘intruder’ protecting his girlfriend. She and her son told the cops that they can’t taze him he’s bipolar and on medication for it and his heart can’t take it and that he was doing no harm.”</p>
<p>Despite the words of those who knew and lived with Couvrette police moved to arrest the man. In the course of the arrest they used a taser.</p>
<p>What Higgins reports is additionally disturbing. She adds that not only did police tase him, but police “held him down and tazed him in the heart.”</p>
<p>Gordon Couvrette was taken to the North Bay Regional Health Centre where he was pronounced dead.</p>

According to the SIU, the police were responding to a 911 call when they encountered a 34-year-old man. The SIU claims the man fled from police and went into the Scugog River where police lost track of him. His body was retrieved from the river by underwater search and rescue on September 17.</p>

According to the SIU, OPP responded to a pedestrian on the eastbound collector lanes of Highway 401 near Yonge Street at about 1:55 AM, Tuesday, September 18, 2018. The SIU claim the man ran away after the officer spoke with him. He allegedly fell through a separation between the highway’s collector and express lanes to the ground below. The man was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:55 AM.</p>
       **<p>Police shot and killed a 32-year-old man in Burlington, Ontario early in the morning of Saturday, September 22, 2018. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, has reported that four Halton Regional Police officers and one Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer were involved in the killing.</p>
<p>According to the SIU, the events leading to the killing started with police looking for someone involved in a vehicular collision. At around 5:30, the SIU reports, police received a call about someone acting suspiciously in a gas station bathroom. No details have been released about what that could mean or why someone would place a call to police about it. When the man exited the bathroom he was shot and killed by police.</p>
<p>Police claim there was a “shootout,” but as we have seen in other cases of police killings of civilians a claim of a shootout is made initially even where multiple police alone are the shooters. In the killing of Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia, initial police reports suggested a shootout had occurred when an officer was injured. It turned out that only officers had weapons on site and the shooting was police inflicted.</p>
<p>Few details have been released at this point. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed publicly. It has not been confirmed publicly that the man killed had anything to do with the collision that police were supposedly investigating initially.</p>

The victim was reportedly medivacked from Kugluktuk to Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife, where he died. Nunavut RCMP have not provided any details about the circumstances of the death, or why the victim was medivacked, but have stated that the incident triggered the force to “engage the RCMP’s External Investigations or Review Policy.”</p>
<p>Inspector Keith Cain, of the Calgary Police Services, reports that four detectives and two members of the Calgary Police Services crime scenes unit were in Kugluktuk the last week of September to do an investigation. They had attended the autopsy in Edmonton.</p>
<p>The investigating officers will compile a report of the incident and give it to a Crown prosecutor, who will decide whether to press charges. It is expected the police “investigation” will take a month and the Crown will review the report over the course of an additional month.  Nunavut’s deputy coroner, Khen Sagadraca, reports that the office is conducting its own “preliminary investigation” into the circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
<p>This is a blatant case of police investigating police and we can expect nothing in the way of justice to come from it. Incredibly, and speaking to the reliability of police in such cases, the Nunavut RCMP did not issue a news release about the in-custody death when it happened. They have since refused to answer questions about this failure to report. Perhaps they needed more time to concoct a story or reconstruct a crime scene.</p>

Officers of the Ottawa Police Service and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) had initiated pursuit of a vehicle driven by the 36-year-old victim.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario) reports that the crash incident was initiated with a call from a man reporting that his daughter had been abused by a family friend at a Kanata hotel. This means the identity of the alleged suspect was known and under Ontario rules a police pursuit should not have been undertaken (where a suspect’s identity is known).</p>
<p>The SIU has designated one Ottawa police officer as the subject of its investigation, and also identified three other “witness officers,” two of whom are OPP officers. The agency assigned three investigators, two forensic specialists, and a collision reconstruction expert to its investigation team.</p>
<p>According to Ottawa defence lawyer Lawrence Greenspon, the main job for the SIU is to determine why the pursuit was launched given the identity of the suspect was known to police. While rules govern when a suspect should be pursued, Greenspon notes that too often those regulations are not followed. He outlines the too regular script followed by police:</p>
<p>“Every time there’s a crash like this it’s the same story: ‘We started the pursuit and it was stopped before the fatal collision took place.’ The big question here that needs to be answered is: Why were they chasing him in the first place? If they knew his identity, why start chasing him?” (quoted in Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the police service’s policy “requires that officers only engage in a pursuit if they believe a crime has been committed and if there’s no alternative for apprehending a suspect who poses a threat to public safety” (Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>

<p>According to Ottawa defence lawyer Lawrence Greenspon, the main job for the SIU is to determine why the pursuit was launched given the identity of the suspect was known to police. While rules govern when a suspect should be pursued, Greenspon notes that too often those regulations are not followed. He outlines the too regular script followed by police:</p>
<p>“Every time there’s a crash like this it’s the same story: ‘We started the pursuit and it was stopped before the fatal collision took place.’ The big question here that needs to be answered is: Why were they chasing him in the first place? If they knew his identity, why start chasing him?” (quoted in Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the police service’s policy “requires that officers only engage in a pursuit if they believe a crime has been committed and if there’s no alternative for apprehending a suspect who poses a threat to public safety” (Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>

<p>The IIO report that RCMP responded to an apartment complex in the 14000 block of 103A Avenue regarding a woman on the edge of a ninth floor balcony. Police entered the building, and, at some point, the woman fell. She died on the scene. No other details have been released publicly.</p>
<p>This is the second IIO investigation of RCMP in a matter of days. Police shot a man on 135A Street in Whalley on August 14.</p>
       **<p>British Columbia RCMP shot and killed a man who has been identified by family members as Kyaw Din (54) at a Maple Ridge home on August 11, 2019. The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

According to the SIU, an Ontario Provincial Police officer was operating a police vehicle in the New Tecumseth area at about 11:40 PM. The officer allegedly observed a Pontiac and began to follow the vehicle. No reason has been given publicly for why the officer took note of the vehicle or decided to pursue it.</p>
<p>At some point the Pontiac became involved in a collision with a Volkswagen in the area of 20th Sideroad and 5th Line. Two women in the Volkswagen, the 23-year-old driver and a 36-year-old passenger, were taken to hospital where the passenger was later pronounced dead. A woman who was a passenger in the Pontiac was also taken to hospital with injuries.</p>

When officers arrived they got into an altercation with a man and fired their weapons. Emergency medical services (EMS) was called to the scene where the man was declared dead.  Marc Kassay said he was working in his garage a block away when he heard several loud pops.  Maureen Hyde, who lives nearby, said earlier the gunshots surprised and scared her.  “Sounded like my poor neighbour’s house blew, I’ve never heard that before,” said Hyde.  Amber Reid said Saturday that her cousin, Marty Powder, was the man who was killed.

Reid said she had only met Powder a few times and did not know any of the circumstances that led to his death.  Police have not confirmed Powder’s identity. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) has been directed to investigate the shooting.  Reid said Powder was the subject of an Edmonton Police Service release in July 2019 warning that he was being released from prison and was considered a violent offender.  The release stated Powder was known to commit offences against people he knew and did not know. He was released on conditions including a curfew from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., refraining from buying, drinking or being in possession of alcohol or drugs and not being able to leave the city of Edmonton without written consent.  He was also not allowed to be in licensed premises or enter into any romantic or sexual relationships without informing his partner of his past convictions.  Neighbours said police were regularly in the area and appeared to be checking on Powder.  Lance Reid, Powder’s nephew, said Powder was trying to turn his life around and he had been doing a good job of doing so.  “He was one of the most peaceful men I knew and a real role model to look to for getting out of the street life and off drugs and alcohol,” said Lance Reid.  “After his last conviction he dropped his gang ties and was living the sober life.”  The last time a person was killed in an Edmonton police officer-involved shooting was in January 2019.

In a statement Thursday, the B.C. RCMP said it has asked the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. to investigate an Oct. 13 incident between two men who knew each other, according to an RCMP statement.  Just before 8 p.m. PT on that day, Nass Valley RCMP were called to the 4300-block of Monroe Street in Gitlaxt'aamiks, formerly known as New Aiyansh, for a report that a man had stabbed someone.  By the time police arrived at the scene, the victim had already been taken to hospital, and neighbours were trying to calm the suspect, the statement said.  As officers tried to take the man into custody, he allegedly used his weapon on himself, it said.  One of the officers then used a stun gun to subdue him, but the suspect continued to struggle, RCMP said.  When there was no ambulance available, officers with the help of several bystanders, managed to get him into a police vehicle for transport to a local clinic where the man died.  RCMP said the IIO B.C. is now investigating to determine whether police actions are linked to the man's death, and no further information will be released.  Gitlaxt'aamiks is one of four Nisga'a communities in the Nass Valley area, located 97 kilometres northwest of Terrace and is home to approximately 1,800 residents.       **
<p>A man died after being tased by Nass Valley RCMP during an arrest in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks in the evening of October 13, 2020. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm in British Columbia, is examining the death.</p>



<p>The IIO reports that officers from the Nass Valley RCMP detachment went to the 4300 block of Monroe Street in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks right before 8 PM on calls of an altercation between two men who knew each other. Police claim that when officers arrived, one man had already been taken to a local medical clinic for treatment of a stab wound and the other man “was being calmed by neighbours.” Police allege that before the man was arrested, he began harming himself. The police responded with violence, tasing him.</p>



<p>It has been reported that several civilians helped police to take the man not custody. He was then transported to the local clinic in a police vehicle. For some reason BC Emergency Health Services was not readily available according to the RCMP. The man died at the clinic.</p>

<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harms in Ontario, is investigating the police killing of a man in Niagara-on-the-Lake on the afternoon of January 5, 2021. A Niagara Regional Police presence has been reported in the area of Line 3 and the Niagara Parkway.</p>



<p>This is a breaking situation and no further details are currently available.</p>



<p>It is now reported that Niagara Regional Police officers were responding to reports of an impaired driver and located a vehicle around 2:20 PM. It has also been reported that a call was made to police regarding two people sleeping in a car. It has not been confirmed that the person killed was related to the call or that the person was driving while impaired. In any event no one should be shot and killed for being impaired or for sleeping in a car.</p>



<p>The SIU has assigned four investigators and three forensic investigators to examine the killing. One NRPS officer has been designated as a subject officer. Two NRPS officers and two Niagara Parks Police officers have been designated as witness officers.</p>

<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has publicly identified the man shot and killed by Niagara Regional Police Service (NRPS) officers on January 5 as 27-year-old Martin Gordyn. Details remain sketchy at this point. Initial reports suggest that police were called regarding someone being impaired and/or two people sleeping in a car. The killing occurred near a park trail.</p>



<p>This appears to have been a major operation given the number of officers involved and the presence of three police forces. According to the SIU, one NRPS officer has been designated as a subject officer. In addition, 23 officers with NRPS, three officers with Niagara Parks Police, and five officers with the Ontario Provincial Police have been designated as witness officers.</p>

Paramedics said they were called to a Toronto Community Housing building at 291 George Street, north of Dundas Street East, at 3:50 a.m. for a report of a man with a severe injury to his chest.  He was rushed to hospital in life-threatening condition.  The Special Investigations Unit later said that police were called to building at 3:30 a.m., where they went to the third floor of building and confronted a 45-year-old man.  A source tells CP24 that heavily-armed emergency task force officers were the ones that confronted the man and fired on him.  The SIU says two officers fired at the man.  He was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:17 a.m., the SIU said.  Police said they were in the building as part of a missing person investigation when they learned of the possibility that someone inside may have had a gun.  Interim Toronto police Chief James Ramer told CP24 that officers are “simultaneously conducting a homicide investigation as a result of a person who was reported missing earlier,” regarding what transpired at the building, but he declined to elaborate.  “We were here and there was an interaction and as a result the SIU has invoked their mandate,” Ramer said.  In a news release issued late Tuesday afternoon, police said that officers had attended the building as part of their “inquiries into a missing woman.”  Police said that “investigators now have reason to believe a person has died under suspicious circumstance,” though it is not clear whether that person is the missing woman that police were looking for.  They are asking anyone who may have been in the building or in the area between Friday and Sunday to contact investigators if they heard or saw anything suspicious.  “A body has not yet been located and investigators continue to carry out inquiries to establish the full circumstances,” the news release notes.  The SIU is called to investigate any incident involving police and a member of the public that results in death, serious injury or an allegation of sexual assault.

Police decided to arrest the man under Mental Health Act provisions. At around 1:27 PM, EPS officers transported the man to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH).</p>



<p>At about 2:22 PM, EPS officers entered the secure room in which the man had been placed, in order to transfer him to another unit. At some point, a “physical altercation” occurred involving three EPS officers, hospital staff, including three security guards, and the man.

<p>A 60-year-old woman fell to her death in North York during a “wellness check” by Toronto police on May 18, 2021. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) reports that Toronto police attended an apartment building at 5785 Yonge Street, near Finch Avenue, to check on the well-being of a woman. They reportedly went to a unit on the eighth floor and briefly spoke with a woman before she went to her bedroom to retrieve a document. At some point the officers were alerted that someone had fallen from the building and it was determined that the person who fell was the woman the officers were speaking with.
