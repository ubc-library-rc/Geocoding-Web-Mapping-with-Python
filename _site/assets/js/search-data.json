    "content": "# Territorial and Cultural Acknowledgement The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent. Map Source --- # Why Do an Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that. It isn't just a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. To learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). ## What Does it Mean? What do we mean when we say **traditional**, **ancestral**, and **unceded territory**? It is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and coven the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. ### **Traditional** Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), and [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/) Nations have traditionally occupied this area. ### **Ancestral** Recognizes territories and cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. One example is language, which has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). ### **Unceded** Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were \"ceded\" by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The [RCMP](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1) was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.

Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi could all be used to explain systemic racism; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to quantify and visualize the scale of the problem. I like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it's completely free! **Packages**: Python has a number of built in functions, but many of the most useful tools and functions come require us to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) packages. * Packages are pre-written blocks of code, sometimes referred to as libraries. * They are built for addressing specific tasks: e.g. linear algebra, mapping, plotting. # Geocoding The process of attributing coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) to descriptive locations (Street Address). With Python, we can use a variety of web based services (Google Maps, Mapbox, Open Street Maps, etc.) to perform geocoding. We're using Mapbox today because it strikes a good balance between cost and accuracy. [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) is arguably the best geocoding service, but it costs money :/ (5.00 USD per 1000 request). [Open Street Maps](https://osmnames.org/) is totally free, but it is error prone. [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/) is free, up to [100,000 requests per month](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#geocode) and gives fairly reliable results. We will be using a module called [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to interface with Mapbox for us. **Using Mapbox**: Create a free [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) account. Once you have an account, you will be given an [access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Which lets you use the Mapbox service. # Web Mapping Web mapping takes cartography beyond static maps. Today, we'll use a Python package called [follium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) which allows us to create dynamic, interactive web maps that can be embedded in webpages. Folium will \"translate\" our python commands into Javascrpt and create [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) maps. Leaflet is a Javascript package for creating beautiful functional web maps. Follium is already installed, so we don't have any more steps to do here! ",

View Map in New Tab # Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada? Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873. Police play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people and they work to maintain systems of oppression throughout in Canadian society. Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is \"just an American issue\" and that Canada is \"better\". As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years. * We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable. ## Notes on Terminology **Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force. Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force. **Police-Involved Deaths** Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police. Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc. This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics. ## Increasing Police Violence in Canada There has been an [increasing trend](https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/#increasing-police-violence-in-canada) in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years. This may be partly an result of greater access to information, but it is also likely that Canadian Police *are* becoming more violent. ",
