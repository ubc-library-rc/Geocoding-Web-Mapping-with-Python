    "content": "# Geocoding The process of attributing coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) to descriptive locations (Street Address). With Python, we can use a variety of web based services (google maps, mapbox, open street map, etc.) to perform geocoding. We're using mapbox today because it strikes a good balance between cost and accuracy. [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) is argualbly the best geocoding service, but it costs money :/ (5.00 USD per 1000 request). [Open Street Maps](https://osmnames.org/) is totally free, but it is errorprone. [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/) is free, up to [100,000 requests per month](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#geocode) and gives fairly reliable results. We will be using a module called [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to interface with Mapbox for us. ## Using Mapbox Create a free [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) accont. Once you have an account, you will be given an [access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Which lets you use the mapbox service. ## Installing geopy In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the geopy package pip install geopy Open Video in new tab Your browser does not support iframes. # Web Mapping Web mapping takes cartography beyond static maps. Today, we'll use a Python package called [gollium]http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/ which allows us to create dynamic, interactive webmaps that can be embedded in webpages. Folium will \"translate\" our python commands into Javascrpt and create [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) maps. Leaflet is a javascript Follium is already installed, so we don't have any more steps to do here! # Getting Started with Geocoding You can close the terminal window, we don't need it anymore.

But its not the only language. Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi could all be used to explain systemic racism; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to quantify and visualize the scale of the problem. like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it's completely free! ## Packages Python has a number of built in functionality, but many of the most useful tools and functions come require us to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) packages. * Packages are pre-written blocks of code, sometimes referred to as libraries. * They are built for addressing specific tasks: e.g. linear algebra, mapping, plotting. ## Accessing Python Today We'll be using a UBC server with python already installed on it. If you want to install Python on your own computer, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). * Anaconda will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you. * Anaconda won't install *every* package we're using today, but installing new packages is fairly straightforward. ## Other resources If you're having issues with Python, a great place to check out is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). It is a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions. * A related site that is more GIS focused site is [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) # Download the Code and Data **1**{: .label .label-red } **Start a Jupyter Lab** UBC provides server space where you can run Python using [Jupyter Lab](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter). Login with your CWL. You'll then be taken to a blank jupyter lab. * This is good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system. * This may sound intimidating/confusing. But don't worry, its easy. You don't need to know command line to do this. I'll walk you through step by step.

Take this scenario: * You are a GIS analyst working with a non-profit in Toronto and you've been asked to put together a map highlighting the racial disparities in police violence at the hands of the Toronto Police. The map needs to be interactive and compatible with mobile devices. The non-profit has a limited budget, they can't afford an expensive ESRI license to use ArcMap Online. Leaflet maps are the ideal solution here, they're free and effective. * A dataset covering the years 2000-2017 is available with demographics data describing the victims. However many incomplete records, the police refuse to release information identifying the victims in many cases. The data also has the addresses where the incidents occurred. To compensate for this, you decide to add census data to the map to show the demographics of the populations where the incidents are occurring.

Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. Map Source ## Why Do a Territorial Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that. It isn't just a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. The maps and information presented below are sourced from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). ## What Does it Mean? Why do we say *traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory*? **Traditional**: recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), and [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/)Nations have traditionally occupied this area. **Ancestral**: recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation. It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land. Language has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). **Unceded**: refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty. # Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada? Canadian policing institutions rely on secrecy and the a of statistics to perpetuate the narrative that police violence and systemic racism are \"just American issues\" and that Canada is \"better\". As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years. But it is patently untrue, police violence and systemic racism are serious issues in Canadian society and they need to be part of the public discourse in order to dismantle these systems of oppression and hold Canadian institutions accountable. # Learning Objectives 1) Cursory overview to python 2) Introduction to geocoding with python 3) Creating simple web-maps with python ## The end goal of the workshop is to produce an interactive web-map Your browser does not support iframes.
